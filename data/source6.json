Infinite behind\nThe piling centuries were trodden blind\nIn gulfs chaotic -- so He could not see\nWhen He was not who always had To Be.\nNot even godly fortitude can stare\nInto Eternity\n nor easy bear\nThe insolent vacuity of Time:\nIt is too much\n the mind can never climb\nUp to its meaning\n for\n without an end\n\nWithout beginning\n plan\n or scope\n or trend\nTo point a path\n there nothing is to hold\nAnd steady surmise: so the mind is rolled\nAnd swayed and drowned in dull Immensity.\nEternity outfaces even Me\nWith its indifference\n and the fruitless year\nWould swing as fruitless were I never there.\nAnd so for ever\n day and night the same\n\nYears flying swiftly nowhere\n like a game\nPlayed random by a madman\n without end\nOr any reasoned object but to spend\nWhat is unspendable -- Eternal Woe!\nO Weariness of Time that fast or slow\nGoes never further\n never has in view\nAn ending to the thing it seeks to do\n\nAnd so does nothing: merely ebb and flow\n\nFrom nowhere into nowhere\n touching so\nThe shores of many stars and passing on\n\nCareless of what may come or what has gone.\nO solitude unspeakable! to be\nFor ever with oneself! never see\nAn equal face\n or feel an equal hand\n\nTo sit in state and issue reprimand\n\nAdmonishment or glory\n and to smile\nDisdaining what has happen\u00e8d the while!\nO to be breast to breast against a foe!\nAgainst a friend! to strive and not to know\nThe laboured outcome: love nor be aware\nHow much the other loved\n and greatly care\nWith passion for that happy love or hate\n\nNor know what joy or dole was hid in fate.\nFor I have ranged the spacy width and gone\nSwift north and south\n striving to look upon\nAn ending somewhere. Many days I sped\nHard to the west\n a thousand years I fled\nEastwards in fury\n but I could not find\nThe fringes of the Infinite. Behind\nAnd yet behind\n and ever at the end\nCame new beginnings\n paths that did not wend\nTo anywhere were there: and ever vast\nAnd vaster spaces opened -- till at last\nDizzied with distance\n thrilling to a pain\nUnnameable\n I turned to Heaven again.\nAnd there My angels were prepared to fling\nThe cloudy incense\n there prepared to sing\nMy praise and glory -- O\n in fury I\nThen roared them senseless\n then threw down the sky\nAnd stamped upon it\n buffeted a star\nWith my great fist\n and flung the sun afar:\nShouted My anger till the mighty sound\nRung to the width\n frighting the furthest bound\nAnd scope of hearing: tumult vaster still\n\nThroning the echo\n dinned My ears\n until\nI fled in silence\n seeking out a place\nTo hide Me from the very thought of Space.\nAnd so\n He thought\n in Mine own Image I\nHave made a man\n remote from Heaven high\nAnd all its humble angels: I have poured\nMy essence in his nostrils: I have cored\nHis heart with My own spirit; part of Me\n\nHis mind with laboured growth unceasingly\nMust strive to equal Mine; must ever grow\nBy virtue of My essence till he know\nBoth good and evil through the solemn test\nOf sin and retribution\n till\n with zest\n\nHe feels his godhead\n soars to challenge Me\nIn Mine own Heaven for supremacy.\nThrough savage beasts and still more savage clay\n\nInvincible\n I bid him fight a way\nTo greater battles\n crawling through defeat\nInto defeat again: ordained to meet\nDisaster in disaster; prone to fall\n\nI prick him with My memory to call\nDefiance at his victor and arise\nWith anguished fury to his greater size\nThrough tribulation\n terror\n and despair.\nAstounded\n he must fight to higher air\n\nClimb battle into battle till he be\nConfronted with a flaming sword and Me.\nSo growing age by age to greater strength\n\nTo greater beauty\n skill and deep intent:\nWith wisdom wrung from pain\n with energy\nNourished in sin and sorrow\n he will be\nStrong\n pure and proud an enemy to meet\n\nTremendous on a battle-field\n or sweet\nTo walk by as friend with candid mind.\n--Dear enemy or friend so hard to find\n\nI yet shall find you\n yet shall put My breast\nIn enmity or love against your breast:\nShall smite or clasp with equal ecstasy\nThe enemy or friend who grows to Me.\nThe topmost blossom of his growing I\nShall take unto Me\n cherish and lift high\nBeside myself upon My holy throne: --\nIt is not good for God to be alone.\nThe perfect woman of his perfect race\nShall sit beside Me in the highest place\nAnd be my Goddess\n Queen\n Companion\n Wife\n\nThe rounder of My majesty\n the life\nOf My ambition. She will smile to see\nMe bending down to worship at her knee\nWho never bent before\n and she will say\n\n'Dear God\n who was it taught Thee how to pray?\"\nAnd through eternity\n adown the slope\nOf never-ending time\n compact of hope\n\nOf zest and young enjoyment\n I and She\nWill walk together\n sowing jollity\nAmong the raving stars\n and laughter through\nThe vacancies of Heaven\n till the blue\nVast amplitudes of space lift up a song\n\nThe echo of our presence\n rolled along\nAnd ever rolling where the planets sing\nThe majesty and glory of the King.\nThen conquered\n thou\n Eternity\n shalt lie\nUnder My hand as little as a fly.\nI am the Master: I the mighty God\nAnd you My workshop. Your pavilions trod\nBy Me and Mine shall never cease to be\n\nFor you are but the magnitude of Me\n\nThe width of My extension\n the surround\nOf My dense splendour. Rolling\n rolling round\n\nTo steeped infinity\n and out beyond\nMy own strong comprehension\n you are bond\nAnd servile to My doings.

on the platform of endless alcoholic days;\nWhen you\u2019re sprawled vacant and naked in the corner of your filthy room\n\nOblivious to the scurrying life outside \u2013\nThat which doesn\u2019t

lost behind her frown\nBut in ways she may never know\nHer love fine it's way to show\nAnd by her love she is bound\nOn the lonely side of town\nYou can hear the old train sound\nReminding her of those days\nWhen life glowed with brighter rays\nEven on that lonely side of town\nOn the lonely side of town\nShe is loved by leaps and bounds\nEven though she may not see\nLove'S the only thing

the sight that is most sharp and keen\nEndure their captain's flaming head to see?\nHow much less those\n much higher in degree\n\nAnd so much fairer\n and much more than these\n\nAs these are fairer than the land and seas?\nFor far above these heavens\n which here we see\n\nBe others far exceeding these in light\n\nNot bounded\n not corrupt\n as these same be\n\nBut infinite in largeness and in height\n\nUnmoving\n uncorrupt\n and spotless bright\n\nThat need no sun t' illuminate their spheres\n\nBut their own native light far passing theirs.\nAnd as these heavens still by degrees arise\n\nUntil they come to their first Mover's bound\n\nThat in his mighty compass doth comprise\n\nAnd carry all the rest with him around;\nSo those likewise do by degrees redound\n\nAnd rise more fair; till they at last arrive\nTo the most fair\n whereto they all do strive.\nFair is the heaven where happy souls have place\n\nIn full enjoyment of felicity\n\nWhence they do still behold the

thee\n\nThou turn to nought\n and quite confounded be.\nBut lowly fall before his mercy seat\n\nClose covered with the Lamb's integrity\nFrom the just wrath of his avengeful threat\nThat sits upon the righteous throne on high;\nHis throne is built upon eternity\n\nMore firm and durable than steel or brass\n\nOr the hard diamond\n which them both doth pass.\nHis sceptre is the rod of righteousness\n\nWith which he bruiseth all his foes to dust\n\nAnd the great Dragon strongly doth repress\n\nUnder the rigour of his judgement just;\nHis seat is truth\n to which the faithful trust\n\nFrom whence proceed her beams so pure and bright\nThat all about him sheddeth glorious light:\nLight far exceeding that bright blazing spark\nWhich darted is from Titan's flaming head\n\nThat with his beams enlumineth the dark\nAnd dampish air\n whereby all things are read;\nWhose nature yet so much is marvelled\nOf mortal wits\n that it doth much amaze\nThe greatest wizards which thereon do gaze.\nBut that immortal light\n which there doth shine\n\nIs many thousand times more bright\n more clear\n\nMore excellent\n more glorious\n more divine\n\nThrough which to God all mortal actions here\n\nAnd even the thoughts of men\n do plain appear;\nFor from th' eternal truth it doth proceed\n\nThrough heavenly virtue which her beams do breed.\nWith the great glory of that wondrous light\nHis throne is all encompassed around\n\nAnd hid in his own brightness from the sight\nOf all that look thereon with eyes unsound;\nAnd underneath his feet are to be found\nThunder and lightning and tempestuous fire\n\nThe instruments of his avenging ire.\nThere in his bosom Sapience doth sit\n\nThe sovereign darling of the Deity\n\nClad like a queen in royal robes\n most fit\nFor so great power and peerless majesty\n\nAnd all with gems and jewels gorgeously\nAdorn'd\n that brighter than the stars appear\n\nAnd make her native brightness seem more clear.\nAnd on her head a crown of purest gold\nIs set\n in sign of highest sovereignty;\nAnd in her hand a sceptre she doth hold\n\nWith which she rules the house of God on high\n\nAnd manageth the ever-moving sky\n\nAnd in the same these lower creatures all\nSubjected to her power imperial.\nBoth heaven and earth obey unto her will\n\nAnd all the creatures which they both contain;\nFor of her fullness which the world doth fill\nThey all partake\n and do in state remain\nAs their great Maker did at first ordain\n\nThrough observation of her high behest\n\nBy which they first were made\n and still increast.\nThe fairness of her face no tongue can tell;\nFor she the daughters of all women's race\n\nAnd angels eke\n in beauty doth excel\n\nSparkled on her from God's own glorious face\n\nAnd more increas'd by her own goodly grace\n\nThat it doth far exceed all human thought\n\nNe can on earth compared be to aught.\nNe could that painter (had he lived yet)\nWhich pictured Venus with so curious quill\n\nThat all posterity admired it\n\nHave portray'd this\n for all his mast'ring skill;\nNe she herself\n had she remained still\n\nAnd were as fair as fabling wits do feign\n\nCould once come near this beauty sovereign.\nBut had those wits\n the wonders of their days\n\nOr that sweet Teian poet\n which did spend\nHis plenteous vein in setting forth her praise\n\nSeen but a glimpse of this which I pretend\n\nHow wondrously would he her face commend\n\nAbove that idol of his feigning thought\n\nThat all the world should with his rhymes be fraught.\nHow then dare I\n the novice of his art\n\nPresume to picture so divine a wight\n\nOr hope t' express her least perfection's part\n\nWhose beauty fills the heavens with her light\n\nAnd darks the earth with shadow of her sight?\nAh\n gentle Muse\n thou art too weak and faint\nThe portrait of so heavenly hue to paint.\nLet angels\n which her goodly face behold\nAnd see at will\n her sovereign praises sing\n\nAnd those most sacred mysteries unfold\nOf that fair love of mighty heaven's King;\nEnough is me t' admire so heavenly thing\n\nAnd being thus with her huge love possest\n\nIn th' only wonder of herself to rest.\nBut whoso may\n thrice happy man him hold\n\nOf all on earth whom God so much doth grace\nAnd lets his own beloved to behold;\nFor in the view of her celestial face\nAll joy\n all bliss\n all happiness\n have place;\nNe aught on earth can want unto the wight\nWho of herself can win the wishful sight.\nFor she\n out of her secret treasury\n\nPlenty of riches forth on him will pour\n\nEven heavenly riches\n which there hidden lie\nWithin the closet of her chastest bower\n\nTh' eternal portion of her precious dower\n\nWhich mighty God hath given to her free\n\nAnd to all those which thereof worthy be.\nNone thereof worthy be\n but those whom she\nVouchsafeth to her presence to receive\n\nAnd letteth them her lovely face to see\n\nWhereof such wondrous pleasures they conceive\n\nAnd sweet contentment\n that it doth bereave\nTheir soul of sense\n through infinite delight\n\nAnd them transport from flesh into the spright.\nIn which they see such admirable things\n\nAs carries them into an ecstasy\n\nAnd hear such heavenly notes\n and carollings\nOf God's high praise\n that fills the brazen sky;\nAnd feel such joy and pleasure inwardly\n\nThat maketh them all worldly cares forget\n\nAnd only think on that before them set.\nNe from thenceforth doth any fleshly sense\n\nOr idle thought of earthly things\n remain;\nBut all that erst seem'd sweet seems now offence\n\nAnd all that pleased erst now seems to pain;\nTheir joy\n their comfort\n their desire\n their gain\n\nIs fixed all on that which now they see;\nAll other sights but feigned shadows be.\nAnd that fair lamp\n which useth to inflame\nThe hearts of men with self-consuming fire\nThenceforth seems foul\n and full of sinful blame;\nAnd all that pomp to which proud minds aspire\nBy name of honour\n and so much desire\n\nSeems to them baseness\n and all riches dross\n\nAnd all mirth sadness\n and all lucre loss.\nSo full their eyes are of that glorious sight\n\nAnd senses fraught with such satiety\n\nThat in nought else on earth they can delight\n\nBut in th' aspect of that felicity\n\nWhich they have written in their inward eye;\nOn which they feed\n and in their fastened mind\nAll happy joy and full contentment find.\nAh\n then\n my hungry soul\n which long hast fed\nOn idle fancies of thy foolish thought\n\nAnd\n with false beauty's flatt'ring bait misled\n\nHast after vain deceitful shadows sought\n\nWhich all are fled\n and now have left thee nought\nBut late repentance through thy follies prief;\nAh cease to gaze on matter of thy grief:\nAnd look at last up to that sovereign light\n\nFrom whose pure beams all perfect beauty springs\n\nThat kindleth love in every godly sprite\n\nEven the love of God\n which loathing brings\nOf this vile world and these

above these heavens\n which here we see\n\nBe others far exceeding these in light\n\nNot bounded\n not corrupt\n as these same be\n\nBut infinite in largeness and in height\n\nUnmoving\n uncorrupt\n and spotless bright\n\nThat need no sun t' illuminate their spheres\n\nBut their own native light far passing theirs.\nAnd as these heavens still by degrees arise\n\nUntil they come to their first Mover's bound\n\nThat in his mighty compass doth comprise\n\nAnd carry all the rest with him around;\nSo those likewise do by degrees redound\n\nAnd rise more fair; till they at last arrive\nTo the most fair\n whereto they all do strive.\nFair is the heaven where happy souls have place\n\nIn full enjoyment of felicity\n\nWhence they do still behold the glorious face\nOf the divine eternal Majesty;\nMore fair is that\n where those Ideas on high\nEnranged be\n which Plato so admired\n\nAnd pure Intelligences from God inspired.\nYet fairer is that heaven\n in which do reign\nThe sovereign Powers and mighty Potentates\n\nWhich in their high protections do contain\nAll mortal princes and imperial states;\nAnd fairer yet\n whereas the royal Seats\nAnd heavenly Dominations are set\n\nFrom whom all earthly governance is fet.\nYet far more fair be those bright Cherubins\n\nWhich all with golden wings are overdight\n\nAnd those eternal burning Seraphins\n\nWhich from their faces dart out fiery light;\nYet fairer than they both\n and much more bright\n\nBe th' Angels and Archangels\n which attend\nOn God's own person\n without rest or end.\nThese thus in fair each other far excelling\n\nAs to the highest they approach more near\n\nYet is that highest far beyond all telling\n\nFairer than all the rest which there appear\n\nThough all their beauties join'd together were;\nHow then can mortal tongue hope to express\nThe image of such endless perfectness?\nCease then\n my tongue\n and lend unto my mind\nLeave to bethink how great that beauty is\n\nWhose utmost parts so beautiful I find;\nHow much more those essential parts of his\n\nHis truth\n his love\n his wisdom\n and his bliss\n\nHis grace\n his doom\n his mercy\n and his might\n\nBy which he lends us of himself a sight.\nThose unto all he daily doth display\n\nAnd shew himself in th' image of his grace\n\nAs in a looking-glass\n through which he may\nBe seen of all his creatures vile and base\n\nThat are unable else to see his face\n\nHis glorious face which glistereth else so bright\n\nThat th' Angels selves cannot endure his sight.\nBut we\n frail wights\n whose sight cannot sustain\nThe sun's bright beams when he on us doth shine\n\nBut that their points rebutted back again\nAre dull'd\n how can we see with feeble eyne\nThe glory of that Majesty Divine\n\nIn sight of whom both sun and moon are dark\n\nCompared to his least resplendent spark?\nThe means\n therefore\n which unto us is lent\nHim to behold\n is on his works to look\n\nWhich he hath made in beauty excellent\n\nAnd in the same\n as in a brazen book\n\nTo read enregister'd in every nook\nHis goodness\n which his beauty doth declare;\nFor all that's good is beautiful and fair.\nThence gathering plumes of perfect speculation\n\nTo imp the wings of thy high-flying mind\n\nMount up aloft through heavenly contemplation\n\nFrom this dark world\n whose damps the soul so blind\n\nAnd\n like the native brood of eagles' kind\n\nOn that bright Sun of Glory fix thine eyes\n\nClear'd from gross mists of frail infirmities.\nHumbled with fear and awful reverence\n\nBefore the footstool of his majesty\nThrow thyself down\n with trembling innocence\n\nNe dare look up with corruptible eye\nOn the dread face of that great Deity\n\nFor fear\n lest if he chance to look on thee\n\nThou turn to nought\n and quite confounded be.\nBut lowly fall before his mercy seat\n\nClose covered with the Lamb's integrity\nFrom the just wrath of his avengeful threat\nThat sits upon the righteous throne on high;\nHis throne is built upon eternity\n\nMore firm and durable than steel or brass\n\nOr the hard diamond\n which them both doth pass.\nHis sceptre is the rod of righteousness\n\nWith which he bruiseth all his foes to dust\n\nAnd the great Dragon strongly doth repress\n\nUnder the rigour of his judgement just;\nHis seat is truth\n to which the faithful trust\n\nFrom whence proceed her beams so pure and bright\nThat all about him sheddeth glorious light:\nLight far exceeding that bright blazing spark\nWhich darted is from Titan's flaming head\n\nThat with his beams enlumineth the dark\nAnd dampish air\n whereby all things are read;\nWhose nature yet so much is marvelled\nOf mortal wits\n that it doth much amaze\nThe greatest wizards which thereon do gaze.\nBut that immortal light\n which there doth shine\n\nIs many thousand times more bright\n more clear\n\nMore excellent\n more glorious\n more divine\n\nThrough which to God all mortal actions here\n\nAnd even the thoughts of men\n do plain appear;\nFor from th' eternal truth it doth proceed\n\nThrough heavenly virtue which her beams do breed.\nWith the great glory of that wondrous light\nHis throne is all encompassed around\n\nAnd hid in his own brightness from the sight\nOf all that look thereon with eyes unsound;\nAnd underneath his feet are to be found\nThunder and lightning and tempestuous fire\n\nThe instruments of his avenging ire.\nThere in his bosom Sapience doth sit\n\nThe sovereign darling of the Deity\n\nClad like a queen in royal robes\n most fit\nFor so great power and peerless majesty\n\nAnd all with gems and jewels gorgeously\nAdorn'd\n that brighter than the stars appear\n\nAnd make her native brightness seem more clear.\nAnd on her head a crown of purest gold\nIs set\n in sign of highest sovereignty;\nAnd in her hand a sceptre she doth hold\n\nWith which she rules the house of God on high\n\nAnd manageth the ever-moving sky\n\nAnd in the same these lower creatures all\nSubjected to her power imperial.\nBoth heaven and earth obey unto her will\n\nAnd all the creatures which they both contain;\nFor of her fullness which the world doth fill\nThey all partake\n and do in state remain\nAs their great Maker did at first ordain\n\nThrough observation of her high behest\n\nBy which they first were made\n and still increast.\nThe fairness of her face no tongue can tell;\nFor she the daughters of all women's race\n\nAnd angels eke\n in beauty doth excel\n\nSparkled on her from God's own glorious face\n\nAnd more increas'd by her own goodly grace\n\nThat it doth far exceed all human thought\n\nNe can on earth compared be to aught.\nNe could that painter (had he lived yet)\nWhich pictured Venus with so curious quill\n\nThat all posterity admired it\n\nHave portray'd this\n for all his mast'ring skill;\nNe she herself\n had she remained still\n\nAnd were as fair as fabling wits do feign\n\nCould once come near this beauty sovereign.\nBut had those wits\n the wonders of their days\n\nOr that sweet Teian poet\n which did spend\nHis plenteous vein in setting forth her praise\n\nSeen but a glimpse of this which I pretend\n\nHow wondrously would he her face commend\n\nAbove that idol of his feigning thought\n\nThat all the world should with his rhymes be fraught.\nHow then dare I\n the novice of his art\n\nPresume to picture so divine a wight\n\nOr hope t' express her least perfection's part\n\nWhose beauty fills the heavens with her light\n\nAnd darks the earth with shadow of her sight?\nAh\n gentle Muse\n thou art too weak and faint\nThe portrait of so heavenly hue to paint.\nLet angels\n which her goodly face behold\nAnd see at will\n her sovereign praises sing\n\nAnd those most sacred mysteries unfold\nOf that fair love of mighty heaven's King;\nEnough is me t' admire so heavenly thing\n\nAnd being thus with her huge love possest\n\nIn th' only wonder of herself to rest.\nBut whoso may\n thrice happy man him hold\n\nOf all on earth whom God so much doth grace\nAnd lets his own beloved to behold;\nFor in the view of her celestial face\nAll joy\n all bliss\n all happiness\n have place;\nNe aught on earth can want unto the wight\nWho of herself can win the wishful sight.\nFor she\n out of her secret treasury\n\nPlenty of riches forth on him will pour\n\nEven heavenly riches\n which there hidden lie\nWithin the closet of her chastest bower\n\nTh' eternal portion of her precious dower\n\nWhich mighty God hath given to her free\n\nAnd to all those which thereof worthy be.\nNone thereof worthy be\n but those whom she\nVouchsafeth to her presence to receive\n\nAnd letteth them her lovely face to see\n\nWhereof such wondrous pleasures they conceive\n\nAnd sweet contentment\n that it doth bereave\nTheir soul of sense\n through infinite delight\n\nAnd them transport from flesh into the spright.\nIn which they see such admirable things\n\nAs carries them into an ecstasy\n\nAnd hear such heavenly notes\n and carollings\nOf God's high praise\n that fills the brazen sky;\nAnd feel such joy and pleasure inwardly\n\nThat maketh them all worldly cares forget\n\nAnd only think on that before them set.\nNe from thenceforth doth any fleshly sense\n\nOr idle thought of earthly things\n remain;\nBut all that erst seem'd sweet seems now offence\n\nAnd all that pleased erst now seems to pain;\nTheir joy\n their comfort\n their desire\n their gain\n\nIs fixed all on that which now they see;\nAll other sights but feigned shadows be.\nAnd that fair lamp\n which useth to inflame\nThe hearts of men with self-consuming fire\nThenceforth seems foul\n and full of sinful blame;\nAnd all that pomp to which proud minds aspire\nBy name of honour\n and so much desire\n\nSeems to them baseness\n and all riches dross\n\nAnd all mirth sadness\n and all lucre loss.\nSo full their eyes are of that glorious sight\n\nAnd senses fraught with such satiety\n\nThat in nought else on earth they can delight\n\nBut in th' aspect of that felicity\n\nWhich they have written in their inward eye;\nOn which they feed\n and in their fastened mind\nAll happy joy and full contentment find.\nAh\n then\n my hungry soul\n which long hast fed\nOn idle fancies of thy foolish thought\n\nAnd\n with false beauty's flatt'ring bait misled\n\nHast after vain deceitful shadows sought\n\nWhich all are fled\n and now have left thee nought\nBut late repentance through thy follies prief;\nAh cease to gaze on matter of thy grief:\nAnd look at last up to that sovereign light\n\nFrom whose pure beams all perfect beauty springs\n\nThat kindleth love in every godly sprite\n\nEven the love of God\n which loathing brings\nOf this vile world and these gay-seeming things;\nWith whose sweet pleasures being so possest\n\nThy straying thoughts henceforth for ever rest."}, {"0": {"the wick appears wc": [3, 4, 39, 43]}, "1": {"frozen channels discontented men": [10, 13, 18, 70]}, "3": {"bade spent channels":

sprouting out of my skull. I needed a job\n but first\n I needed a haircut.\nSo I head for this beauty salon on Avenue B.\nI'm gonna get a hairdo.\nI'm gonna look just like those hot Spanish haircut models\n become brown and bodacious\n grow some 7 inch fingernails painted bitch red and rake them down the chalkboard of the job market's soul.\nSo I go in the beauty salon.\nThis beautiful Puerto Rican girl in tight white spandex and a push-up bra sits me down and starts chopping my hair:\n\"Girlfriend\n\" she says\n \"what the hell you got growing outta your head there\n what is that\n hair implants? Yuck\n you want me to touch that shit\n whadya got in there\n sandwiches?\"\nI just go: \"I'm sorry.\"\nShe starts snipping my carefully cultivated Johnny Lydon post-Pistols hairdo. My foul little dreadlocks are flying around all over the place but I'm not looking in the mirror cause I just don't want to know.\n\"So what's your name anyway?\" My stylist demands then.\n\"Uh\n Maggie.\"\n\"Maggie? Well\n that's an okay name\n but my name is Suzy.\"\n\"Yeah\n so?\"\n\"Yeah so it ain't just Suzy S.U.Z.Y\n I spell it S.U.Z.E.E\n the extra \"e\" is for extra Suzee.\"\nI nod emphatically.\nSuzee tells me when she's not busy chopping hair\n she works as an exotic dancer at night to support her boyfriend named Rocco. Suzee loves Rocco\n she loves him so much she's got her eyes closed as she describes him:\n\"6 foot 2\n 193 pounds and\n girlfriend\n his arms so big and long they wrap around me twice like I'm a little Suzee sandwich.\"\nLittle Suzee Sandwich is rapt\n she blindly snips and clips at my poor punk head. She snips and clips and snips and clips\n she pauses\n I look in the mirror: \"Holy shit\n I'm bald.\"\n\"Holy shit\n baby\n you're bald.\" Suzee says\n finally opening her eyes and then gasping.\nAll I've got left is little post-nuke clumps of orange fuzz. And I'll never get a receptionist job now.\nBut Suzy waves her manicured finger in my face: \"Don't you worry\n baby\n I'm gonna get you a job at the dancing club.\"\n\"What?\"\n\" ;Baby\n let me tell you\n the boys are gonna like a bald go go dancer.\"\nThat said\n she whips out some clippers\n shaves my head smooth and insists I'm gonna love getting naked for a living.\nNone of this sounds like my idea of a good time\n but I'm broke and I'm bald so I go home and get my best panties. Suzee lends me some 6 inch pumps\n paints my lips bright red\n and gives me 7 shots of Jack Daniels to relax me.\n8pm that night I take the stage.\nI'm bald\n\nI'm drunk\n\nand by god\n\nI'm naked.\nHOLY SHIT I'M NAKED IN A ROOM FULL OF STRANGERS THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE RECURRING NIGHTMARES WE ALL HAVE ABOUT BEING BUTT NAKED IN PUBLIC\n I AM NAKED\n I DON'T KNOW THESE PEOPLE\n THIS REALLY SUCKS.\nA few guys feel sorry for me and risk getting their hands bitten off by sticking dollars in my garter belt. My disheveled pubic hairs stand at full attention\n ready to poke the guys' eyes out if they get too close.\nThen I notice this bald guy in the audience\n I've got a new empathy for bald people\n I figure maybe it works both ways\n maybe this guy will stick 10 bucks in my garter.\nI saunter over.\nI'm teetering around unrhythmically\n I'm the surliest\n unsexiest dancer that ever go-go across this hemisphere. The bald guy looks down into his beer\n he'd much rather look at that than at my pubic mound which has now formed into one vicious spike so it looks like I've got a unicorn in my crotch.\nI stand there weaving through the air.\nThe strobe light is illuminating my pubic unicorn. Madonna's song Borderline is pumping through the club's speaker system for the 5th time tonight: \"BORDERLINE BORDERLINE BORDERLINE/LOVE ME TIL I JUST CAN'T SEE.\" And suddenly\n I start to wonder: What does that mean anyway?\n\"LOVE ME TIL I JUST CAN'T SEE\"\nWhat?\nScrew me so much my eyes pop out\n I go blind\n end up walking down 2nd Avenue crazy\n horny\n naked and blind? What?\nThere's a glitch in the tape and it starts to skip.\n\"Borderl...ooop.....Borderl.... ooop...Borderlin.....ooop\"\nI stumble and twist my ankle. My g-string rides between my buttcheeks making me twitch with pain. My head starts spinning\n my knees wobble\n I go down on all fours and puke all over the bald guy's lap.\nSo there I am. Butt naked on all fours.

I am the Life of Life.'\n'Tis thus by near approach to an eternal presence\nman's heart with divine furor kindled and possess'd\nfalleth in blind surrender; and finding therewithal\nin fullest devotion the full reconcilement\nbetwixt his animal and spiritual desires\n\nsuch welcome hour of bliss standeth for certain pledge\nof happiness perdurable: and coud he sustain\nthis great enthusiasm\n then the unbounded promise\nwould keep fulfilment; since the marriage of true minds\nis thatt once fabled garden\n amidst of which was set\nthe single Tree that bore such med'cinable fruit\nthat if man ate thereof he should liv for ever.\nFriendship is in loving rather than in being lov'd\n\nwhich is its mutual benediction and recompense;\nand tho' this be\n and tho' love is from lovers learn'd\n\nit springeth none the less from the old essence of self.\nNo friendless man ('twas well said) can be truly himself;\nwhat a man looketh for in his friend and findeth\n\nand loving self best\n loveth better than himself\n\nis his own better self\n his live lovable idea\n\nflowering by expansion in the loves of his life.\nAnd in the nobility of our earthly friendships\nwe hav al grades of attainment\n and the best may claim\nperfection of kind; and so\n since ther be many bonds\nother than breed (friendships of lesser motiv\n found\neven in the brutes) and since our politick is based\non actual association of living men\n 'twil come\nthat the spiritual idea of Friendship\n the huge\nvastidity of its essence\n is fritter'd away\nin observation of the usual habits of men;\nas happ'd with the great moralist\n where his book saith\nthat ther can be no friendship betwixt God and man\nbecause of their unlimited disparity.\nFrom this dilemma of pagan thought\n this poison of faith\n\nMan-soul made glad escape in the worship of Christ;\nfor his humanity is God's Personality\n\nand communion with him is the life of the soul.\nOf which living ideas (when in the struggle of thought\nharden'd by language they became symbols of faith)\nReason builded her maze\n wherefrom none should escape\n\nwandering intent to map and learn her tortuous clews\n\nchanting their clerkly creed to the high-echoing stones\nof their hand-fashion'd temple: but the Wind of heav'n\nbloweth where it listeth\n and Christ yet walketh the earth\n\nand talketh still as with those two disciples once\non the road to Emmaus-where they walk and are sad;\nwhose vision of him then was his victory over death\n\nthatt resurrection which all his lovers should share\n\nwho in loving him had learn'd the Ethick of happiness;\nwhereby they too should come where he was ascended\nto reign over men's hearts in the Kingdom of God.\nOur happiest earthly comradeships hold a foretaste\nof the feast of salvation and by thatt virtue in them\nprovoke desire beyond them to out-reach and surmount\ntheir humanity in some superhumanity\nand ultimat perfection: which\n howe'ever 'tis found\nor strangeley imagin'd\n answereth to the need of each\nand pulleth him instinctivly as to a final cause.\nThus unto all who hav found their high ideal in Christ\n\nChrist is to them the essence discern'd or undeiscern'd\nof all their human friendships; and each lover of him\nand of his beauty must be as a bud on the Vine\nand hav participation in him; for Goddes love\nis unescapable as nature's environment\n\nwhich if a man ignore or think to thrust it off\nhe is the ill-natured fool that runneth blindly on death.\nThis Individualism is man's true Socialism.\nThis is the rife Idea whose spiritual beauty\nmultiplieth in communion to transcendant might.\nThis is thatt excelent way whereon if we wil walk\nall things shall be added unto us-thatt Love which inspired\nthe wayward Visionary in his doctrinal ode\nto the three christian Graces\n the Church's first hymn\nand only deathless athanasian creed\n--the which\n'except a man believe he cannot be saved.'\nThis is the endearing bond whereby Christ's company\nyet holdeth together on the truth of his promise\nthat he spake of his grat pity and trust in man's love\n\n'Lo\n I am with you always ev'n to the end of the world.'\nTruly the Soul returneth the body's loving\nwhere it hath won it...and God so loveth the world...\nand in the fellowship of the friendship of Christ\nGod is seen as the very self-essence of love\n\nCreator and mover of all as activ Lover of all\n\nself-express'd in not-self\n mind and body\n mother and child\n\n'twixt lover and loved\n God and man: but ONE ETERNAL\nin the love of Beauty

flights of ample stairs.\nHer mein\n her shape\n her temper\n eyes and tongue\nAre sure to conquer. -- for the rogue is young;\nAnd all that's madly wild\n or oddly gay\n\nWe call it only pretty Fanny's way.\nLet time that makes you homely\n make you sage\n\nThe sphere of wisdom is the sphere of age.\n'Tis true\n when beauty dawns with early fire\n\nAnd hears the flatt'ring tongues of soft desire\n\nIf not from virtue\n from its gravest ways\nThe soul with pleasing avocation strays.\nBut beauty gone\n 'tis easier to be wise;\nAs harper better\n by the loss of eyes.\nHenceforth retire\n reduce your roving airs\n\nHaunt less the plays\n and more the publick pray'rs\n\nReject the Mechlin Head\n and gold brocade\n\nGo pray\n in sober Norwich Crape array'd.\nThy pendent diamonds let thy Fanny take\n\n(Their trembling lustre shows how much you shake;)\nOr bid her wear thy necklace row'd with pearl\n\nYou'll find your Fanny an obedient girl.\nSo for the rest\n with less incumbrance hung\n\nYou walk thro' life\n unmingled with the young;\nAnd view the shade and substance as you pass\nWith joint endeavour trifling at the glass\n\nOr Folly drest\n and rambling all her days\n\nTo meet her counterpart\n and grow by praise:\nYet still sedate your self\n and gravely plain\n\nYou neither fret\n nor envy at the vain.\n'Twas thus (if Man with Woman we compare)\nThe wise Athenian crost a glittering fair\n\nUnmov'd by tongues and sights\n he walk'd the place\n\nThro' tape\n toys\n tinsel\n gimp\n perfume\n and lace;\nThen bends from Mars's Hill his awful eyes\n\nAnd \"What a world I never want?\" he cries;\nBut cries unheard: For Folly will be free.\nSo parts the buzzing gaudy crowd\n and he:\nAs careless he for them\n as they for him;\nHe wrapt in wisdom\n and they whirl'd by whim."}, {"poem": "988\nThe Definition of Beauty is\nThat Definition is none\u2014\nOf Heaven\n easing Analysis\n\nSince Heaven and He are one."}, {"0": {"a walk was ground": [3, 4, 51,

understanding left to itself can effect much. It is by instruments and helps that the work is done\n which are as much wanted for the understanding as for the hand. And as the instruments of the hand either give motion or guide it\n so the instruments of the mind supply either suggestions for the understanding or cautions.\nIII.\nHuman knowledge and human power meet in one; for where the cause is not known the effect cannot be produced. Nature to be commanded must be obeyed; and that which in contemplation is as the cause is in operation as the rule.\nIV.\nTowards the effecting of works\n all that man can do is to put together or put asunder natural bodies. The rest is done by nature working within.\nV.\nThe study of nature with a view to works is engaged in by the mechanic\n the mathematician\n the physician\n the alchemist\n and the magician; but by all (as things now are) with slight endeavour and scanty success.\nVI.\nIt would be an unsound fancy and self-contradictory to expect that things which have never yet been done can be done except by means which have never yet been tried.\nVII.\nThe productions of the mind and hand seem very numerous in books and manufactures. But all this variety lies in an exquisite subtlety and derivations from a few things already known; not in the number of axioms.\nVIII.\nMoreover the works already known are due to chance and experiment rather than to sciences; for the sciences we now possess are merely systems for the nice ordering and setting forth of things already invented; not methods of invention or directions for new works.\nIX.\nThe cause and root of nearly all evils in the sciences is this -- that while we falsely admire and extol the powers of the human mind we neglect to seek for its true helps.\nX.\nThe subtlety of nature is greater many times over than the subtlety of the senses and understanding; so that all those specious meditations\n speculations\n and glosses in which men indulge are quite from the purpose\n only there is no one by to observe it.\nXI.\nAs the sciences which we now have do not help us in finding out new works\n so neither does the logic which we now have help us in finding out new sciences.\nXII.\nThe logic now in use serves rather to fix and give stability to the errors which have their foundation in commonly received notions than to help the search after truth. So it does more harm than good.\nXIII.\nThe syllogism is not applied to the first principles of sciences\n and is applied in vain to intermediate axioms; being no match for the subtlety of nature. It commands assent therefore to the proposition\n but does not take hold of the thing.\nXIV.\nThe syllogism consists of propositions\n propositions consist of words\n words are symbols of notions. Therefore if the notions themselves (which is the root of the matter) are confused and over-hastily abstracted from the facts\n there can be no firmness in the superstructure. Our only hope therefore lies in a true induction.\nXV.\nThere is no soundness in our notions whether logical or physical. Substance\n Quality\n Action\n Passion\n Essence itself\n are not sound notions: much less are Heavy\n Light\n Dense\n Rare\n Moist\n Dry\n Generation\n Corruption\n Attraction\n Repulsion\n Element\n Matter\n Form\n and the like; but all are fantastical and ill defined.\nXVI.\nOur notions of less general species\n as Man\n Dog\n Dove\n and of the immediate perceptions of the sense\n as Hot\n Cold\n Black\n White\n do not materially mislead us; yet even these are sometimes confused by the flux and alteration of matter and the mixing of one thing with another. All the others which men have hitherto adopted are but wanderings\n not being abstracted and formed from things by proper methods.\nXVII.\nNor is there less of wilfulness and wandering in the construction of axioms than in the formations of notions; not excepting even those very principles which are obtained by common induction; but much more in the axioms and lower propositions educed by the syllogism.\nXVIII.\nThe discoveries which have hitherto been made in the sciences are such as lie close to vulgar notions\n scarcely beneath the surface. In order to penetrate into the inner and further recesses of nature\n it is necessary that both notions and axioms be derived from things by a more sure and guarded way; and that a method of intellectual operation be introduced altogether better and more certain.\nXIX.\nThere are and can be only two ways of searching into and discovering truth. The one flies from the senses and particulars to the most general axioms\n and from these principles\n the truth of which it takes for settled and immovable\n proceeds to judgment and to the discovery of middle axioms. And this way is now in fashion. The other derives axioms from the senses and particulars\n rising by a gradual and unbroken ascent\n so that it arrives at the most general axioms last of all. This is the true way\n but as yet untried.\nXX.\nThe understanding left to itself takes the same course (namely\n the former) which it takes in accordance with logical order. For the mind longs to spring up to positions of higher generality\n that it may find rest there; and so after a little while wearies of experiment. But this evil is increased by logic\n because of the order and solemnity of its disputations.\nXXI.\nThe understanding left to itself\n in a sober\n patient\n and grave mind\n especially if it be not hindered by received doctrines\n tries a little that other way\n which is the right one\n but with little progress; since the understanding\n unless directed and assisted\n is a thing unequal\n and quite unfit to contend with the obscurity of things.\nXXII.\nBoth ways set out from the senses and particulars\n and rest in the highest generalities; but the difference between them is infinite. For the one just glances at experiment and particulars in passing\n the other dwells duly and orderly among them. The one\n again\n begins at once by establishing certain abstract and useless generalities\n the other rises by gradual steps to that which is prior and better known in the order of nature.\nXXIII.\nThere is a great difference between the Idols of the human mind and the Ideas of the divine. That is to say\n between certain empty dogmas\n and the true signatures and marks set upon the works of creation as they are found in nature.\nXXIV.\nIt cannot be that axioms established by argumentation should avail for the discovery of new works; since the subtlety of nature is greater many times over than the subtlety of argument. But axioms duly and orderly formed from particulars easily discover the way to new particulars\n and thus render sciences active.\nXXV.\nThe axioms now in use\n having been suggested by a scanty and manipular experience and a few particulars of most general occurrence\n are made for the most part just large enough to fit and take these in: and therefore it is no wonder if they do not lead to new particulars. And if some opposite instance\n not observed or not known before\n chance to come in the way\n the axiom is rescued and preserved by some frivolous distinction; whereas the truer course would be to correct the axiom itself.\nXXVI.\nThe conclusions of human reason as ordinarily applied in matter of nature\n I call for the sake of distinction Anticipations of Nature (as a thing rash or premature). That reason which is elicited from facts by a just and methodical process\n I call Interpretation of Nature.\nXXVII.\nAnticipations are a ground sufficiently firm for consent; for even if men went mad all after the same fashion\n they might agree one with another well enough.\nXXVIII.\nFor the winning of assent\n indeed\n anticipations are far more powerful than interpretations; because being collected from a few instances\n and those for the most part of familiar occurrence\n they straightway touch the understanding and fill the imagination; whereas interpretations on the other hand\n being gathered here and there from very various and widely dispersed facts\n cannot suddenly strike the understanding; and therefore they must needs\n in respect of the opinions of the time\n seem harsh and out of tune; much as the mysteries of faith do.\nXXIX.\nIn sciences founded on opinions and dogmas\n the use of anticipations and logic is good; for in them the object is to command assent to the proposition\n not to master the thing.\nXXX.\nThough all the wits of all the ages should meet together and combine and transmit their labours\n yet will no great progress ever be made in science by means of anticipations; because radical errors in the first concoction of the mind are not to be cured by the excellence of functions and remedies subsequent.\nXXXI.\nIt is idle to expect any great advancement in science from the superinducing and engrafting of new things upon old. We must begin anew from the very foundations\n unless we would revolve for ever in a circle with mean and contemptible progress.\nXXXII.\nThe honour of the ancient authors\n and indeed of all\n remains untouched; since the comparison I challenge is not of wits or faculties\n but of ways and methods\n and the part I take upon myself is not that of a judge\n but of a guide.\nXXXIII.\nThis must be plainly avowed: no judgment can be rightly formed either of my method or of the discoveries to which it leads\n by means of anticipations (that is to say\n of the reasoning which is now in use); since I cannot be called on to abide by the sentence of a tribunal which is itself on its trial.\nXXXIV.\nEven to deliver and explain what I bring forward is no easy matter; for things in themselves new will yet be apprehended with reference to what is old.\nXXXV.\nIt was said by Borgia of the expedition of the French into Italy\n that they came with chalk in their hands to mark out their lodgings\n not with arms to force their way in. I in like manner would have my doctrine enter quietly into the minds that are fit and capable of receiving it; for confutations cannot be employed\n when the difference is upon first principles and very notions and even upon forms of demonstration.\nXXXVI.\nOne method of delivery alone remains to us; which is simply this: we must lead men to the particulars themselves\n and their series and order; while men on their side must force themselves for awhile to lay their notions by and begin to familiarise themselves with facts.\nXXXVII.\nThe doctrine of those who have denied that certainty could be attained at all\n has some agreement with my way of proceeding at the first setting out; but they end in being infinitely separated and opposed. For the holders of that doctrine assert simply that nothing can be known; I also assert that not much can be known in nature by the way which is now in use. But then they go on to destroy the authority of the senses and understanding; whereas I proceed to devise and supply helps for the same.\nXXXVIII.\nThe idols and false notions which are now in possession of the human understanding\n and have taken deep root therein\n not only so beset men's minds that truth can hardly find entrance\n but even after entrance obtained\n they will again in the very instauration of the sciences meet and trouble us\n unless men being forewarned of the danger fortify themselves as far as may be against their assaults.\nXXXIX.\nThere are four classes of Idols which beset men's minds. To these for distinction's sake I have assigned names\n -- calling the first class Idols of the Tribe; the second\n Idols of the Cave; the third\n Idols of the Market-place; the fourth\n Idols of the Theatre.\nXL.\nThe formation of ideas and axioms by true induction is no doubt the proper remedy to be applied for the keeping off and clearing away of idols. To point them out\n however\n is of great use; for the doctrine of Idols is to the Interpretation of Nature what the doctrine of the refutation of Sophisms is to common Logic.\nXLI.\nThe Idols of the Tribe have their foundation in human nature itself\n and in the tribe or race of men. For it is a false assertion that the sense of man is the measure of things. On the contrary\n all perceptions as well of the sense as of the mind are according to the measure of the individual and not according to the measure of the universe. And the human understanding is like a false mirror\n which\n receiving rays irregularly\n distorts and discolours the nature of things by mingling its own nature with it.\nXLII.\nThe Idols of the Cave are the idols of the individual man. For every one (besides the errors common to human nature in general) has a cave or den of his own\n which refracts and discolours the light of nature; owing either to his own proper and peculiar nature; or to his education and conversation with others; or to the reading of books\n and the authority of those whom he esteems and admires; or to the differences of impressions\n accordingly as they take place in a mind preoccupied and predisposed or in a mind indifferent and settled; or the like. So that the spirit of man (according as it is meted out to different individuals) is in fact a thing variable and full of perturbation\n and governed as it were by chance. Whence it was well observed by Heraclitus that men look for sciences in their own lesser worlds\n and not in the greater or common world.\nXLIII.\nThere are also Idols formed by the intercourse and association of men with each other\n which I call Idols of the Market-place\n on account of the commerce and consort of men there. For it is by discourse that men associate; and words are imposed according to the apprehension of the vulgar. And therefore the ill and unfit choice of words wonderfully obstructs the understanding. Nor do the definitions or explanations wherewith in some things learned men are wont to guard and defend themselves\n by any means set the matter right. But words plainly force and overrule the understanding\n and throw all into confusion\n and lead men away into numberless empty controversies and idle fancies.\nXLIV.\nLastly\n there are Idols which have immigrated into men's minds from the various dogmas of philosophies\n and also from wrong laws of demonstration. These I call Idols of the Theatre; because in my judgment all the received systems are but so many stage-plays\n representing worlds of their own creation after an unreal and scenic fashion. Nor is it only of the systems now in vogue\n or only of the ancient sects and philosophies\n that I speak; for many more plays of the same kind may yet be composed and in like artificial manner set forth; seeing that errors the most widely different have nevertheless causes for the most part alike. Neither again do I mean this only of entire systems\n but also of many principles and axioms in science\n which by tradition\n credulity\n and negligence have come to be received.\nBut of these several kinds of Idols I must speak more largely and exactly\n that the understanding may be duly cautioned.\nXLV.\nThe human understanding is of its own nature prone to suppose the existence of more order and regularity in the world than it finds. And though there be many things in nature which are singular and unmatched\n yet it devises for them parallels and conjugates and relatives which do not exist. Hence the fiction that all celestial bodies move in perfect circles; spirals and dragons being (except in name) utterly rejected. Hence too the element of Fire with its orb is brought in\n to make up the square with the other three which the sense perceives. Hence also the ratio of density of the so-called elements is arbitrarily fixed at ten to one. And so on of other dreams. And these fancies affect not dogmas only\n but simple notions also.\nXLVI.\nThe human understanding when it has once adopted an opinion (either as being the received opinion or as being agreeable to itself) draws all things else to support and agree with it. And though there be a greater number and weight of instances to be found on the other side\n yet these it either neglects and despises\n or else by some distinction sets aside and rejects; in order that by this great and pernicious predetermination the authority of its former conclusions may remain inviolate. And therefore it was a good answer that was made by one who when they showed him hanging in a temple a picture of those who had paid their vows as having escaped shipwreck\n and would have him say whether he did not now acknowledge the power of the gods\n -- \"Aye\n\" asked he again\n \"but where are they painted that were drowned after their vows?\" And such is the way of all superstition\n whether in astrology\n dreams\n omens\n divine judgments\n or the like; wherein men\n having a delight in such vanities\n mark the events where they are fulfilled\n but where they fail\n though this happen much oftener\n neglect and pass them by. But with far more subtlety does this mischief insinuate itself into philosophy and the sciences; in which the first conclusion colours and brings into conformity with itself all that come after\n though far sounder and better. Besides\n independently of that delight and vanity which I have described\n it is the peculiar and perpetual error of the human intellect to be more moved and excited by affirmatives than by negatives; whereas it ought properly to hold itself indifferently disposed towards both alike. Indeed in the establishment of any true axiom\n the negative instance is the more forcible of the two.\nXLVII.\nThe human understanding is moved by those things most which strike and enter the mind simultaneously and suddenly\n and so fill the imagination; and then it feigns and supposes all other things to be somehow\n though it cannot see how\n similar to those few things by which it is surrounded. But for that going to and fro to remote and heterogeneous instances\n by which axioms are tried as in the fire\n the intellect is altogether slow and unfit\n unless it be forced thereto by severe laws and overruling authority.\nXLVIII.\nThe human understanding is unquiet; it cannot stop or rest\n and still presses onward\n but in vain. Therefore it is that we cannot conceive of any end or limit to the world; but always as of necessity it occurs to us that there is something beyond. Neither again can it be conceived how eternity has flowed down to the present day; for that distinction which is commonly received of infinity in time past and in time to come can by no means hold; for it would thence follow that one infinity is greater than another\n and that infinity is wasting away and tending to become finite. The like subtlety arises touching the infinite divisibility of lines\n from the same inability of thought to stop. But this inability interferes more mischievously in the discovery of causes: for although the most general principles in nature ought to be held merely positive\n as they are discovered\n and cannot with truth be referred to a cause; nevertheless the human understanding being unable to rest still seeks something prior in the order of nature. And then it is that in struggling towards that which is further off it falls back upon that which is more nigh at hand; namely\n on final causes: which have relation clearly to the nature of man rather than to the nature of the universe; and from this source have strangely defiled philosophy. But he is no less an unskilled and shallow philosopher who seeks causes of that which is most general\n than he who in things subordinate and subaltern omits to do so.\nXLIX.\nThe human understanding is no dry light\n but receives an infusion from the will and affections; whence proceed sciences which may be called \"sciences as one would.\" For what a man had rather were true he more readily believes. Therefore he rejects difficult things from impatience of research; sober things\n because they narrow hope; the deeper things of nature\n from superstition; the light of experience\n from arrogance and pride\n lest his mind should seem to be occupied with things mean and transitory; things not commonly believed\n out of deference to the opinion of the vulgar. Numberless in short are the ways\n and sometimes imperceptible\n in which the affections colour and infect the understanding.\nL.\nBut by far the greatest hindrance and aberration of the human understanding proceeds from the dullness\n incompetency\n and deceptions of the senses; in that things which strike the sense outweigh things which do not immediately strike it\n though they be more important. Hence it is that speculation commonly ceases where sight ceases; insomuch that of things invisible there is little or no observation. Hence all the working of the spirits inclosed in tangible bodies lies hid and unobserved of men. So also all the more subtle changes of form in the parts of coarser substances (which they commonly call alteration\n though it is in truth local motion through exceedingly small spaces) is in like manner unobserved. And yet unless these two things just mentioned be searched out and brought to light\n nothing great can be achieved in nature\n as far as the production of works is concerned. So again the essential nature of our common air\n and of all bodies less dense than air (which are very many)\n is almost unknown. For the sense by itself is a thing infirm and erring; neither can instruments for enlarging or sharpening the senses do much; but all the truer kind of interpretation of nature is effected by instances and experiments fit and apposite; wherein the sense decides touching the experiment only\n and the experiment touching the point in nature and the thing itself.\nLI.\nThe human understanding is of its own nature prone to abstractions and gives a substance and reality to things which are fleeting. But to resolve nature into abstractions is less to our purpose than to dissect her into parts; as did the school of Democritus\n which went further into nature than the rest. Matter rather than forms should be the object of our attention\n its configurations and changes of configuration\n and simple action\n and law of action or motion; for forms are figments of the human mind\n unless you will call those laws of action forms.\nLII.\nSuch then are the idols which I call Idols of the Tribe; and which take their rise either from the homogeneity of the substance of the human spirit\n or from its preoccupation\n or from its narrowness\n or from its restless motion\n or from an infusion of the affections\n or from the incompetency of the senses\n or from the mode of impression.\nLIII.\nThe Idols of the Cave take their rise in the peculiar constitution\n mental or bodily\n of each individual; and also in education\n habit\n and accident. Of this kind there is a great number and variety; but I will instance those the pointing out of which contains the most important caution\n and which have most effect in disturbing the clearness of the understanding.\nLIV.\nMen become attached to certain particular sciences and speculations\n either because they fancy themselves the authors and inventors thereof\n or because they have bestowed the greatest pains upon them and become most habituated to them. But men of this kind\n if they betake themselves to philosophy and contemplations of a general character\n distort and colour them in obedience to their former fancies; a thing especially to be noticed in Aristotle\n who made his natural philosophy a mere bond-servant to his logic\n thereby rendering it contentious and well nigh useless. The race of chemists again out of a few experiments of the furnace have built up a fantastic philosophy\n framed with reference to a few things; and Gilbert also\n after he had employed himself most laboriously in the study and observation of the loadstone\n proceeded at once to construct an entire system in accordance with his favourite subject.\nLV.\nThere is one principal and as it were radical distinction between different minds\n in respect of philosophy and the sciences; which is this: that some minds are stronger and apter to mark the differences of things\n others to mark their resemblances. The steady and acute mind can fix its contemplations and dwell and fasten on the subtlest distinctions: the lofty and discursive mind recognises and puts together the finest and most general resemblances. Both kinds however easily err in excess\n by catching the one at gradations the other at shadows.\nLVI.\nThere are found some minds given to an extreme admiration of antiquity\n others to an extreme love and appetite for novelty: but few so duly tempered that they can hold the mean\n neither carping at what has been well laid down by the ancients\n nor despising what is well introduced by the moderns. This however turns to the great injury of the sciences and philosophy; since these affectations of antiquity and novelty are the humours of partisans rather than judgments; and truth is to be sought for not in the felicity of any age\n which is an unstable thing\n but in the light of nature and experience\n which is eternal. These factions therefore must be abjured\n and care must be taken that the intellect be not hurried by them into assent.\nLVII.\nContemplations of nature and of bodies in their simple form break up and distract the understanding\n while contemplations of nature and bodies in their composition and configuration overpower and dissolve the understanding: a distinction well seen in the school of Leucippus and Democritus as compared with the other philosophies. For that school is so busied with the particles that it hardly attends to the structure; while the others are so lost in admiration of the structure that they do not penetrate to the simplicity of nature. These kinds of contemplation should therefore be alternated and taken by turns; that so the understanding may be rendered at once penetrating and comprehensive\n and the inconveniences above mentioned\n with the idols which proceed from them\n may be avoided.\nLVIII.\nLet such then be our provision and contemplative prudence for keeping off and dislodging the Idols of the Cave\n which grow for the most part either out of the predominance of a favourite subject\n or out of an excessive tendency to compare or to distinguish\n or out of partiality for particular ages\n or out of the largeness or minuteness of the objects contemplated. And generally let every student of nature take this as a rule\n -- that whatever his mind seizes and dwells upon with peculiar satisfaction is to be held in suspicion\n and that so much the more care is to be taken in dealing with such questions to keep the understanding even and clear.\nLIX.\nBut the Idols of the Market-place are the most troublesome of all: idols which have crept into the understanding through the alliances of words and names. For men believe that their reason governs words; but it is also true that words react on the understanding; and this it is that has rendered philosophy and the sciences sophistical and inactive. Now words\n being commonly framed and applied according to the capacity of the vulgar\n follow those lines of division which are most obvious to the vulgar understanding. And whenever an understanding of greater acuteness or a more diligent observation would alter those lines to suit the true divisions of nature\n words stand in the way and resist the change. Whence it comes to pass that the high and formal discussions of learned men end oftentimes in disputes about words and names; with which (according to the use and wisdom of the mathematicians) it would be more prudent to begin\n and so by means of definitions reduce them to order. Yet even definitions cannot cure this evil in dealing with natural and material things; since the definitions themselves consist of words\n and those words beget others: so that it is necessary to recur to individual instances\n and those in due series and order; as I shall say presently when I come to the method and scheme for the formation of notions and axioms.\nLX.\nThe idols imposed by words on the understanding are of two kinds. They are either names of things which do not exist (for as there are things left unnamed through lack of observation\n so likewise are there names which result from fantastic suppositions and to which nothing in reality corresponds)\n or they are names of things which exist\n but yet confused and ill-defined\n and hastily and irregularly derived from realities. Of the former kind are Fortune\n the Prime Mover\n Planetary Orbits\n Element of Fire\n and like fictions which owe their origin to false and idle theories. And this class of idols is more easily expelled\n because to get rid of them it is only necessary that all theories should be steadily rejected and dismissed as obsolete.\nBut the other class\n which springs out of a faulty and unskilful abstraction\n is intricate and deeply rooted. Let us take for example such a word as humid; and see how far the several things which the word is used to signify agree with each other; and we shall find the word humid to be nothing else than a mark loosely and confusedly applied to denote a variety of actions which will not bear to be reduced to any constant meaning. For it both signifies that which easily spreads itself round any other body; and that which in itself is indeterminate and cannot solidise; and that which readily yields in every direction; and that which easily divides and scatters itself; and that which easily unites and collects itself; and that which readily flows and is put in motion; and that which readily clings to another body and wets it; and that which is easily reduced to a liquid\n or being solid easily melts. Accordingly when you come to apply the word\n -- if you take it in one sense\n flame is humid; if in another\n air is not humid; if in another\n fine dust is humid; if in another\n glass is humid. So that it is easy to see that the notion is taken by abstraction only from water and common and ordinary liquids\n without any due verification.\nThere are however in words certain degrees of distortion and error. One of the least faulty kinds is that of names of substances\n especially of lowest species and well-deduced (for the notion of chalk and of mud is good\n of earth bad); a more faulty kind is that of actions\n as to generate\n to corrupt\n to alter; the most faulty is of qualities (except such as are the immediate objects of the sense) as heavy\n light\n rare\n dense\n and the like. Yet in all these cases some notions are of necessity a little better than others\n in proportion to the greater variety of subjects that fall within the range of the human sense.\nLXI.\nBut the Idols of the Theatre are not innate\n nor do they steal into the understanding secretly\n but are plainly impressed and received into the mind from the play-books of philosophical systems and the perverted rules of demonstration. To attempt refutations in this case would be merely inconsistent with what I have already said: for since we agree neither upon principles nor upon demonstrations there is no place for argument. And this is so far well\n inasmuch as it leaves the honour of the ancients untouched. For they are no wise disparaged the question between them and me being only as to the way. For as the saying is\n the lame man who keeps the right road outstrips the runner who takes a wrong one. Nay it is obvious that when a man runs the wrong way\n the more active and swift he is the further he will go astray.\nBut the course I propose for the discovery of sciences is such as leaves but little to the acuteness and strength of wits\n but places all wits and understandings nearly on a level. For as in the drawing of a straight line or a perfect circle\n much depends on the steadiness and practice of the hand\n if it be done by aim of hand only\n but if with the aid of rule or compass\n little or nothing; so is it exactly with my plan. But though particular confutations would be of no avail\n yet touching the sects and general divisions of such systems I must say something; something also touching the external signs which show that they are unsound; and finally something touching the causes of such great infelicity and of such lasting and general agreement in error; that so the access to truth may be made less difficult\n and the human understanding may the more willingly submit to its purgation and dismiss its idols.\nLXII.\nIdols of the Theatre\n or of Systems\n are many\n and there can be and perhaps will be yet many more. For were it not that new for many ages men's minds have been busied with religion and theology; and were it not that civil governments\n especially monarchies\n have been averse to such novelties\n even in matters speculative; so that men labour therein to the peril and harming of their fortunes\n -- no"}, {"poem": "Bacon Francis"}, {"0": {"all things round lessons": [11, 13, 28, 31]}, "1":

hand and foot and eyes are parts\nOf one whole breathing creature. But some hold\nThat sense of mind is in no fixed part seated\n\nBut is of body some one vital state\n-\nNamed \"harmony\" by Greeks\n because thereby\nWe live with sense\n though intellect be not\nIn any part: as oft the body is said\nTo have good health (when health\n however\n 's not\nOne part of him who has it)\n so they place\nThe sense of mind in no fixed part of man.\nMightily\n diversly\n meseems they err.\nOften the body palpable and seen\nSickens\n while yet in some invisible part\nWe feel a pleasure; oft the other way\n\nA miserable in mind feels pleasure still\nThroughout his body- quite the same as when\nA foot may pain without a pain in head.\nBesides\n when these our limbs are given o'er\nTo gentle sleep and lies the burdened frame\nAt random void of sense\n a something else\nIs yet within us\n which upon that time\nBestirs itself in many a wise\n receiving\nAll motions of joy and phantom cares of heart.\nNow\n for to see that in man's members dwells\nAlso the soul\n and body ne'er is wont\nTo feel sensation by a \"harmony\"\nTake this in chief: the fact that life remains\nOft in our limbs\n when much of body's gone;\nYet that same life\n when particles of heat\n\nThough few\n have scattered been\n and through the mouth\nAir has been given forth abroad\n forthwith\nForever deserts the veins\n and leaves the bones.\nThus mayst thou know that not all particles\nPerform like parts\n nor in like manner all\nAre props of weal and safety: rather those-\nThe seeds of wind and exhalations warm-\nTake care that in our members life remains.\nTherefore a vital heat and wind there is\nWithin the very body\n which at death\nDeserts our frames. And so\n since nature of mind\nAnd even of soul is found to be\n as 'twere\n\nA part of man\n give over \"harmony\"-\nName to musicians brought from Helicon\n-\nUnless themselves they filched it otherwise\n\nTo serve for what was lacking name till then.\nWhate'er it be\n they're welcome to it- thou\n\nHearken my other maxims.\nMind and soul\n\nI say\n are held conjoined one with other\n\nAnd form one single nature of themselves;\nBut chief and regnant through the frame entire\nIs still that counsel which we call the mind\n\nAnd that cleaves seated in the midmost breast.\nHere leap dismay and terror; round these haunts\nBe blandishments of joys; and therefore here\nThe intellect\n the mind. The rest of soul\n\nThroughout the body scattered\n but obeys-\nMoved by the nod and motion of the mind.\nThis\n for itself\n sole through itself\n hath thought;\nThis for itself hath mirth\n even when the thing\nThat moves it\n moves nor soul nor body at all.\nAnd as\n when head or eye in us is smit\nBy assailing pain\n we are not tortured then\nThrough all the body\n so the mind alone\nIs sometimes smitten\n or livens with a joy\n\nWhilst yet the soul's remainder through the limbs\nAnd through the frame is stirred by nothing new.\nBut when the mind is moved by shock more fierce\n\nWe mark the whole soul suffering all at once\nAlong man's members: sweats and pallors spread\nOver the body\n and the tongue is broken\n\nAnd fails the voice away\n and ring the ears\n\nMists blind the eyeballs\n and the joints collapse\n-\nAye\n men drop dead from terror of the mind.\nHence\n whoso will can readily remark\nThat soul conjoined is with mind\n and\n when\n'Tis strook by influence of the mind\n forthwith\nIn turn it hits and drives the body too.\nAnd this same argument establisheth\nThat nature of mind and soul corporeal is:\nFor when 'tis seen to drive the members on\n\nTo snatch from sleep the body\n and to change\nThe countenance\n and the whole state of man\nTo rule and turn\n- what yet could never be\nSans contact\n and sans body contact fails-\nMust we not grant that mind and soul consist\nOf a corporeal nature?- And besides\nThou markst that likewise with this body of ours\nSuffers the mind and with our body feels.\nIf the dire speed of spear that cleaves the bones\nAnd bares the inner thews hits not the life\n\nYet follows a fainting and a foul collapse\n\nAnd\n on the ground\n dazed tumult in the mind\n\nAnd whiles a wavering will to rise afoot.\nSo nature of mind must be corporeal\n since\nFrom stroke and spear corporeal 'tis in throes.\nNow\n of what body\n what components formed\nIs this same mind I will go on to tell.\nFirst\n I aver\n 'tis superfine\n composed\nOf tiniest particles- that such the fact\nThou canst perceive\n if thou attend\n from this:\nNothing is seen to happen with such speed\nAs what the mind proposes and begins;\nTherefore the same bestirs itself more swiftly\nThan aught whose nature's palpable to eyes.\nBut what's so agile must of seeds consist\nMost round\n most tiny\n that they may be moved\n\nWhen hit by impulse slight. So water moves\n\nIn waves along\n at impulse just the least-\nBeing create of little shapes that roll;\nBut\n contrariwise\n the quality of honey\nMore stable is\n its liquids more inert\n\nMore tardy its flow; for all its stock of matter\nCleaves more together\n since\n indeed\n 'tis made\nOf atoms not so smooth\n so fine\n and round.\nFor the light breeze that hovers yet can blow\nHigh heaps of poppy-seed away for thee\nDownward from off the top; but\n contrariwise\n\nA pile of stones or spiny ears of wheat\nIt can't at all. Thus\n in so far as bodies\nAre small and smooth\n is their mobility;\nBut\n contrariwise\n the heavier and more rough\n\nThe more immovable they prove. Now\n then\n\nSince nature of mind is movable so much\n\nConsist it must of seeds exceeding small\nAnd smooth and round. Which fact once known to thee\n\nGood friend\n will serve thee opportune in else.\nThis also shows the nature of the same\n\nHow nice its texture\n in how small a space\n'Twould go\n if once compacted as a pellet:\nWhen death's unvexed repose gets hold on man\nAnd mind and soul retire\n thou markest there\nFrom the whole body nothing ta'en in form\n\nNothing in weight. Death grants ye everything\n\nBut vital sense and exhalation hot.\nThus soul entire must be of smallmost seeds\n\nTwined through the veins\n the vitals\n and the thews\n\nSeeing that\n when 'tis from whole body gone\n\nThe outward figuration of the limbs\nIs unimpaired and weight fails not a whit.\nJust so\n when vanished the bouquet of wine\n\nOr when an unguent's perfume delicate\nInto the winds away departs\n or when\nFrom any body savour's gone\n yet still\nThe thing itself seems minished naught to eyes\n\nThereby\n nor aught abstracted from its weight-\nNo marvel\n because seeds many and minute\nProduce the savours and the redolence\nIn the whole body of the things. And so\n\nAgain\n again\n nature of mind and soul\n'Tis thine to know created is of seeds\nThe tiniest ever\n since at flying-forth\nIt beareth nothing of the weight away.\nYet fancy not its nature simple so.\nFor an impalpable aura\n mixed with heat\n\nDeserts the dying\n and heat draws off the air;\nAnd heat there's none\n unless commixed with air:\nFor\n since the nature of all heat is rare\n\nAthrough it many seeds of air must move.\nThus nature of mind is triple; yet those all\nSuffice not for creating sense- since mind\nAccepteth not that aught of these can cause\nSense-bearing motions\n and much less the thoughts\nA man revolves in mind. So unto these\nMust added be a somewhat\n and a fourth;\nThat somewhat's altogether void of name;\nThan which existeth naught more mobile\n naught\nMore an impalpable\n of elements\nMore small and smooth and round. That first transmits\nSense-bearing motions through the frame\n for that\nIs roused the first\n composed of little shapes;\nThence heat and viewless force of wind take up\nThe motions\n and thence air\n and thence all things\nAre put in motion; the blood is strook\n and then\nThe vitals all begin to feel\n and last\nTo bones and marrow the sensation comes-\nPleasure or torment. Nor will pain for naught\nEnter so far\n nor a sharp ill seep through\n\nBut all things be perturbed to that degree\nThat room for life will fail\n and parts of soul\nWill scatter through the body's every pore.\nYet as a rule\n almost upon the skin\nThese motion aIl are stopped\n and this is why\nWe have the power to retain our life.\nNow in my eagerness to tell thee how\nThey are commixed\n through what unions fit\nThey function so\n my country's pauper-speech\nConstrains me sadly. As I can\n however\n\nI'll touch some points and pass. In such a wise\nCourse these primordials 'mongst one another\nWith intermotions that no one can be\nFrom other sundered\n nor its agency\nPerform\n if once divided by a space;\nLike many powers in one body they work.\nAs in the flesh of any creature still\nIs odour and savour and a certain warmth\n\nAnd yet from an of these one bulk of body\nIs made complete\n so\n viewless force of wind\nAnd warmth and air\n commingled\n do create\nOne nature\n by that mobile energy\nAssisted which from out itself to them\nImparts initial motion\n whereby first\nSense-bearing motion along the vitals springs.\nFor lurks this essence far and deep and under\n\nNor in our body is aught more shut from view\n\nAnd 'tis the very soul of all the soul.\nAnd as within our members and whole frame\nThe energy of mind and power of soul\nIs mixed and latent\n since create it is\nOf bodies small and few\n so lurks this fourth\n\nThis essence void of name\n composed of small\n\nAnd seems the very soul of all the soul\n\nAnd holds dominion o'er the body all.\nAnd by like reason wind and air and heat\nMust function so\n commingled through the frame\n\nAnd now the one subside and now another\nIn interchange of dominance\n that thus\nFrom all of them one nature be produced\n\nLest heat and wind apart\n and air apart\n\nMake sense to perish\n by disseverment.\nThere is indeed in mind that heat it gets\nWhen seething in rage\n and flashes from the eyes\nMore swiftly fire; there is\n again\n that wind\n\nMuch\n and so cold\n companion of all dread\n\nWhich rouses the shudder in the shaken frame;\nThere is no less that state of air composed\n\nMaking the tranquil breast\n the serene face.\nBut more of hot have they whose restive hearts\n\nWhose minds of passion quickly seethe in rage-\nOf which kind chief are fierce abounding lions\n\nWho often with roaring burst the breast o'erwrought\n\nUnable to hold the surging wrath within;\nBut the cold mind of stags has more of wind\n\nAnd speedier through their inwards rouses up\nThe icy currents which make their members quake.\nBut more the oxen live by tranquil air\n\nNor e'er doth smoky torch of wrath applied\n\nO'erspreading with shadows of a darkling murk\n\nRouse them too far; nor will they stiffen stark\n\nPierced through by icy javelins of fear;\nBut have their place half-way between the two-\nStags and fierce lions. Thus the race of men:\nThough training make them equally refined\n\nIt leaves those pristine vestiges behind\nOf each mind's nature. Nor may we suppose\nEvil can e'er be rooted up so far\nThat one man's not more given to fits of wrath\n\nAnother's not more quickly touched by fear\n\nA third not more long-suffering than he should.\nAnd needs must differ in many things besides\nThe varied natures and resulting habits\nOf humankind- of which not now can I\nExpound the hidden causes\n nor find names\nEnough for all the divers shapes of those\nPrimordials whence this variation springs.\nBut this meseems I'm able to declare:\nThose vestiges of natures left behind\nWhich reason cannot quite expel from us\nAre still so slight that naught prevents a man\nFrom living a life even worthy of the gods.\nSo then this soul is kept by all the body\n\nItself the body's guard\n and source of weal;\nFor they with common roots cleave each to each\n\nNor can be torn asunder without death.\nNot easy 'tis from lumps of frankincense\nTo tear their fragrance forth\n without its nature\nPerishing likewise: so\n not easy 'tis\nFrom all the body nature of mind and soul\nTo draw away\n without the whole dissolved.\nWith seeds so intertwined even from birth\n\nThey're dowered conjointly with a partner-life;\nNo energy of body or mind\n apart\n\nEach of itself without the other's power\n\nCan have sensation; but our sense\n enkindled\nAlong the vitals\n to flame is blown by both\nWith mutual motions. Besides the body alone\nIs nor begot nor grows\n nor after death\nSeen to endure. For not as water at times\nGives off the alien heat\n nor is thereby\nItself destroyed\n but unimpaired remains-\nNot thus\n I say\n can the deserted frame\nBear the dissevering of its joined soul\n\nBut\n rent and ruined\n moulders all away.\nThus the joint contact of the body and soul\nLearns from their earliest age the vital motions\n\nEven when still buried in the mother's womb;\nSo no dissevering can hap to them\n\nWithout their bane and ill. And thence mayst see\nThat\n as conjoined is their source of weal\n\nConjoined also must their nature be.\nIf one\n moreover\n denies that body feel\n\nAnd holds that soul\n through all the body mixed\n\nTakes on this motion which we title \"sense\"\nHe battles in vain indubitable facts:\nFor who'll explain what body's feeling is\n\nExcept by what the public fact itself\nHas given and taught us? \"But when soul is parted\n\nBody's without all sense.\" True!- loses what\nWas even in its life-time not its own;\nAnd much beside it loses\n when soul's driven\nForth from that life-time. Or\n to say that eyes\nThemselves can see no thing\n but through the same\nThe mind looks forth\n as out of opened doors\n\nIs- a hard saying; since the feel in eyes\nSays the reverse. For this itself draws on\nAnd forces into the pupils of our eyes\nOur consciousness. And note the case when often\nWe lack the power to see refulgent things\n\nBecause our eyes are hampered by their light-\nWith a mere doorway this would happen not;\nFor\n since it is our very selves that see\n\nNo open portals undertake the toil.\nBesides\n if eyes of ours but act as doors\n\nMethinks that\n were our sight removed\n the mind\nOught then still better to behold a thing-\nWhen even the door-posts have been cleared away.\nHerein in these affairs nowise take up\nWhat honoured sage\n Democritus\n lays down-\nThat proposition\n that primordials\nOf body and mind\n each super-posed on each\n\nVary alternately and interweave\nThe fabric of our members. For not only\nAre the soul-elements smaller far than those\nWhich this our body and inward parts compose\n\nBut also are they in their number less\n\nAnd scattered sparsely through our frame. And thus\nThis canst thou guarantee: soul's primal germs\nMaintain between them intervals as large\nAt least as are the smallest bodies\n which\n\nWhen thrown against us\n in our body rouse\nSense-bearing motions. Hence it comes that we\nSometimes don't feel alighting on our frames\nThe clinging dust\n or chalk that settles soft;\nNor mists of night\n nor spider's gossamer\nWe feel against us\n when\n upon our road\n\nIts net entangles us\n nor on our head\nThe dropping of its withered garmentings;\nNor bird-feathers\n nor vegetable down\n\nFlying about\n so light they barely fall;\nNor feel the steps of every crawling thing\n\nNor each of all those footprints on our skin\nOf midges and the like. To that degree\nMust many primal germs be stirred in us\nEre once the seeds of soul that through our frame\nAre intermingled 'gin to feel that those\nPrimordials of the body have been strook\n\nAnd ere\n in pounding with such gaps between\n\nThey clash\n combine and leap apart in turn.\nBut mind is more the keeper of the gates\n\nHath more dominion over life than soul.\nFor without intellect and mind there's not\nOne part of soul can rest within our frame\nLeast part of time; companioning\n it goes\nWith mind into the winds away\n and leaves\nThe icy members in the cold of death.\nBut he whose mind and intellect abide\nHimself abides in life. However much\nThe trunk be mangled\n with the limbs lopped off\n\nThe soul withdrawn and taken from the limbs\n\nStill lives the trunk and draws the vital air.\nEven when deprived of all but all the soul\n\nYet will it linger on and cleave to life\n-\nJust as the power of vision still is strong\n\nIf but the pupil shall abide unharmed\n\nEven when the eye around it's sorely rent-\nProvided only thou destroyest not\nWholly the ball\n but\n cutting round the pupil\n\nLeavest that pupil by itself behind-\nFor more would ruin sight. But if that centre\n\nThat tiny part of eye\n be eaten through\n\nForthwith the vision fails and darkness comes\n\nThough in all else the unblemished ball be clear.\n'Tis by like compact that the soul and mind\nAre each to other bound forevermore."}, {"0": {"no nature takes wound": [2, 4, 11, 13]}, "1": {"vulgar nature takes wound": [3, 4, 11, 13]}, "2": {"have this hand": [6, 83, 94]}, "3": {"torpidly shun drugs": [84, 86, 88]}, "4": {"nature confidences relief": [4, 33, 37]}, "5": {"have forfeits the money": [6, 96, 115, 116]}, "7": {"have this hand": [6, 83, 94]}, "8": {"have this hand": [6, 83, 94]}, "9": {"secretive providence this worth money": [8, 73, 83, 114, 116]}, "10": {"vulgar nature this hand": [3, 4, 83, 94]}, "11": {"nature confidences whose acute care": [4, 33, 42, 45, 49]}, "12": {"vulgar nature this hand kiss for this lie": [3, 4, 83, 94, 104, 122, 125, 127]}, "13": {"it have is have": [0, 6, 44, 47]}, "14": {"secretive providence this worth money": [8, 73, 83, 114, 116]}, "15": {"nature confidences relief kiss for this lie": [4, 33, 37, 104, 122, 125, 127]}, "poem": "It is no vulgar nature I have wived.\nSecretive\n sensitive\n she takes a wound\nDeep to her soul\n as if the sense had swooned\n\nAnd not a thought of vengeance had survived.\nNo confidences has she: but relief\nMust come to one whose suffering is acute.\nO have a care of natures that are mute!\nThey punish you in acts: their steps are brief.\nWhat is she doing?
