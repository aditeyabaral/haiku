To map the consequences of regardless, of underestimate,
   Of feverish faith, of the mechanical modernism of your false terrain. As if
Port Sulphur remained nominal, its slick globules merely figurative
      Between territories of wait and wetlands of trust.
 
To etch the shallow-water horizon— a techno-utopian tribute
         To shrimp estuaries, bird rookeries, oyster bays,
To tube worms & sea turtles. To watercolor these pelican grasses,
            Oxidized, unapologetic executive marshes, roseated spoonbills.
 
For you who longed to smear concentric circles,
            To have trusted you with longitude and latitude,
To blur this sargassum border between mourning,
               Fighting, and willful denying of objects and subjects. As if
 
Generations of fishermen, scaling orders of magnitude,
                  Navigated oily streaks of miles in a legend of inches,
Skeletal, ghostly swarms of now-opaque, milky jellyfish. As if
                     to bury the blowout, rescind the rig. To fortify, to intone.
 
If naming were not violence, to witness an active verb:                     Top kill, junk shot, top hat, dance dance revolution.
These wayward scripts a frontier province palimpsest.

He sees through stone
he has the secret eyes
this old black one
who under prison skies
sits pressed by the sun
against the western wall
his pipe between purple gums
 
the years fall
like overripe plums
bursting red flesh
on the dark earth
 
his time is not my time
but I have known him
in a time gone
 
he led me trembling cold
into the dark forest
taught me the secret rites
to make it with a woman
to be true to my brothers
to make my spear drink
the blood of my enemies
 
now black cats circle him
flash white teeth
snarl at the air
mashing green grass beneath
shining muscles
ears peeling his words
he smiles
he knows
the hunt    the enemy
he has the secret eyes
he sees through stone

                    The Violent Space (or when your sister sleeps around for money)
                ","
 Exchange in greed the ungraceful signs. Thrust
The thick notes between green apple breasts.
Then the shadow of the devil descends,
The violent space cries and angel eyes,
Large and dark, retreat in innocence and in ice.
(Run sister run–the Bugga man comes!)
 
The violent space cries silently,
Like you cried wide years ago
In another space, speckled by the sun
And the leaves of a green plum tree,
And you were stung
By a red wasp and we flew home.
(Run sister run–the Bugga man comes!)
 
Well, hell, lil sis, wasps still sting.
You are all of seventeen and as alone now
In your pain as you were with the sting
On your brow.
Well, shit, lil sis, here we are:
You are I and this poem.
And what should I do? should I squat
In the dust and make strange markings on the ground?
Shall I chant a spell to drive the demon away?
(Run sister run–the Bugga man comes!)
 
In the beginning you were the Virgin Mary,
And you are the Virgin Mary now.
But somewhere between Nazareth and Bethlehem
You lost your name in the nameless void.“O Mary don’t you weep don’t you moan” 
O Mary shake your butt to the violent juke,
Absorb the demon puke and watch the white eyes pop,
(Run sister run–the Bugga man comes!)
 
And what do I do. I boil my tears in a twisted spoon
And dance like an angel on the point of a needle.
I sit counting syllables like Midas gold.
I am not bold. I cannot yet take hold of the demon
And lift his weight from you black belly,
So I grab the air and sing my song.
(But the air cannot stand my singing long.)

She is girl. She is gravel. She is grabbed. She is grabbed like handfuls of gravel. Gravel grated by water. Her village is full of gravel fields. It is 1950. She is girl. She is grabbed. She is not my grandmother, though my grandmother is girl. My grandmother’s father closes the gates. Against American soldiers, though they jump over stone walls. To a girl who is not my grandmother. The girl is gravel grabbed. Her language is gravel because it means nothing. Hands full of girl. Fields full of gravel. Korea is gravel and graves. Girl is girl and she will never be a grandmother. She will be girl, girl is gravel and history will skip her like stone over water. Oh girl, oh glory. Girl.

There was a man. A Japanese soldier. One that did not believe in old superstitions. One that did not believe in sex before battle as charm against harm. He was an odd man. One that did not carry an amulet with pubic hair of a comfort woman. Or any piece of her. His comrades said, Be a man. The equation is, an odd man out is not man. There is no reason for logic in war. There is no reason. There was a man. His comrades said, Come raid, come pillage. Pushed him into the station. Their eyes on the holes in the wall. Watched as he came. Became.

My heart knocks on my skin. Someone said
winter has broken his windows. The heat inside
and the cold outside sent lightning across glass.

and ask them to talk about the day—we did this,we did that, sometimes leading somewhere, sometimes
not, but always ending up at the happy ending of now.Now, in still darkness, listening to their breath slow and ease
into sleep's regular rhythm.

St. Joseph’s Hospital, Tacoma WA, 1969-74.



A headache makes your mouth plunge, then it pulls away. The smell of diesel or the smell of rain. Now you are a thick suburb. Under the pressure of a credit card. Your body is a box of mirrors, a mercury mine. You have blossomed and spread, white mystery of spring. All your blood and treasure is spent. O rose, you are sick. The morning rain does not nourish you. Your mouth is caught in a rigid O. Where only deficit is at home. You stand beneath a white hospital, almost drunk. You cannot say why your sense is drenched: exhaustion or debt. What’s the difference again? A braid of eyes. Curtains the color of a dove’s wing. Ceramic lips framed against seismic shatter. “Soft zone.” Meanwhile your uncle is dying in San Francisco and you do not know it. You are standing in front of another hospital whose patients are strangers. You unwind a rope of carbon so that you can post pictures of it on the internet. How much damage does your life do and how can you refuse? O rose, you are sick. Only injury sustains you.

                ","
It was Adolphe Sax, remember,
not Saxo Grammaticus, who gets the ovation.
And by the time he had brought all the components
together–the serpentine shape, the single reed,
the fit of the fingers,
the upward tilt of the golden bell–
it was already 1842, and one gets the feeling
that it was also very late at night.
 
There is something nocturnal about the sound,
something literally horny,
as some may have noticed on that historic date
when the first odd notes wobbled out of his studio
into the small, darkened town,
 
summoning the insomniacs (who were up
waiting for the invention of jazz) to their windows,
but leaving the sleepers undisturbed,
evening deepening and warming the waters of their dreams.
 
For this is not the valved instrument of waking,
more the smoky voice of longing and loss,
the porpoise cry of the subconscious.
No one would ever think of blowing reveille
on a tenor without irony.
The men would only lie in their metal bunks,
fingers twined behind their heads,
afloat on pools of memory and desire.
 
And when the time has come to rouse the dead,
you will not see Gabriel clipping an alto
around his numinous neck.
 
An angel playing the world’s last song
on a glistening saxophone might be enough
to lift them back into the light of earth,
but really no further.
 
Once resurrected, they would only lie down
in the long cemetery grass
or lean alone against a lugubrious yew
and let the music do the ascending–
curling snakes charmed from their baskets–
while they wait for the shrill trumpet solo,
that will blow them all to kingdom come.

on the 2nd floor
above  a corner store
with my sister Leni  & boyfriend soon to be husband Neap  Hoover
her friend Jo-Ann Huffman & her boyfriend Mike Sawyer
then  Elsa Young  (just left Robert who was with Maxine)
who met her lover Jack Wise next door
then my sister Mary
and my boyfriend  soon to be (later to unbe) husband Cliff Andstein
below us
bill bissett & martina & oolya  then painter-jogger  Gordon Payne
& Merrilyn  (who becomes my friend later)  then bill again then Gordon again
next to us
Bing Thom, Jay Bancroft & often Marian Penner, Rick Clarke
across the landing
John and Susan Newlove & children fathered by gerry gilbert
later the Ridgeways
and next to them directly opposite us:
Gerry Geisler (New Design Gallery)
and Helen Sturdy & children
our kitchen faced theirs
apple pies in my oven & stew or toast in theirs
we cd smell everything like the time we fell asleep as pork hocks
simmered in my big red pot
charred and burned almost caught on fire
would have if Gerry hadnt woken us up
and that building a total tinderbox
always worried bill wd start one
my bedroom / study faced
the Molson’s sign and Burrard Street Bridge
and I could watch the west end and highrises and planetarium grow
and white sheets on a clothesline across the street dry
as I’d sit at my bay window
and write and mark
on a smooth board cut to fit exactly the sill
I’d glance up and see
people like  you  &  Jamie  &  Carol  &  Joan  &  Marcia  & the Trumans
and the Gadds  and the Lathams  and Lanny Beckman
walking up and down Yew Street
open the window & shout
drop by on your way back
dropping by
everybody did it
days filled with coffee, tea, poetry, cigarette smoke
crises, trips, talkedy talk talk
painting hard edged  strong coloured
also  intricate silver point mandalas
and collages
a gallon of Calogna Red
one summery Saturday night
became a party
of 100 or even more
dancing in my bedroom to one music on a tape recorder
dancing in the other to another
drumming in the kitchen
talking in the room with the blue-tile fireplace
so many bodies I couldnt hear the music
from  inside the  hallway
just saw the taller heads
moving together to different beats
in almost darkness
that crazy night at the Wahs’ place
if that wasnt a party of this kind
everybody landing on that bed
everybody kissing everybody
we had to go outside to pee
because the lineup for the can so long
somehow to do with that small space
that it was so tight that everybody had to rub every
body simply to go anywhere
It was gorgeous
after the Vancouver Poetry Conference (1963)
Roy Kiyooka started
dropping by   when he left his studio
there’d always be a light on
somewhere in our building
and he could visit  any of us
separately or clustered
one time
he told me he had a painting he wanted to give me
but it was big and heavy
he borrowed a truck and someone helped him
up the dusty always dirty long stairs
with Hoarfrost
which we hung on a wall in a room just big enough to hold
my round oak table
(used to be Bowerings’ they bought a whole household of furniture for $80 and
when they moved they gave it to Joan and then when she moved she stored it
with me)
a wall that later Elsa and I tore apart with a screwdriver and hammer
shouting angry hexes at Robert all the way
after and during that conference--
Olson, Creeley, Duncan, Levertov, Avison, Whalen, Ginsberg--
Roy and I became friends
and there were readings in my room
every second Sunday
red cast iron pot full of bean soup, corn chowder, spicey meatball vegetable stew
simmering and then cheese scones in the oven
people would come and read their new work one week
and the next week there’d be a Tish meeting
with Daphne Marlatt, Dan MacLeod, Pete Auxier, David Cull & David Dawson
rent $60 a month didnt change
and some years it was cold
the wind so cold on side facing the North Shore
that Hydro was $60 per month
and that wall frozen behind my pillows
the police were something else
they felt they had a right to question anybody so
Cliff would be up at the laundromat on 4th or
at Jackson’s to get some hamburger and be walking back with an
economics book in one hand and meat wrapped in brown paper in the other
and they’d stop him and ask him what he was doing and my friend Ray Wargo
would get stopped almost every second time he’d drop in to visit
where are you going and why and how long will you be
someone was always getting busted
someone was always tripping out
someone was always visiting from   or going to  Europe or Japan
here is a journal entry on June 9:
evening of the first ever national leaders debate on TV
“I am looking forward to seeing Trudeau--hope he gets pushed into/onto
answering more directly than he has in the past. I, like many others including
every gay man I know, do have a crush on him: he has much more style than
any Canadian politician so far. I mean style in the true sense of the word, it is
him, not affected… Cliff, of course, doesn’t trust him at all and thinks he’s a sell-
out. I don’t go that far, yet. But I do think that compromising is the only way a
politician can work this country and I do not like all the PR, razzmatazz,
fundraising, and allegiances that go into just getting elected: our system seems
to be based on gullibility…”
coming home at night up Yew Street
whether from downtown or the beach or Paul the butcher’s or Elsie the baker’s
I loved looking up at my North-facing windows
goldy  gold  mesh curtains
light filtering through
so warm  and so inviting

I am forced to sleepwalk much of the time.
We hold on to these old ways, are troubled
sometimes and then the geyser goes away,
time gutted. In and of itself there is
no great roar, force pitted against force that
makes up in time what it loses in speed.
The waterfalls, the canyon, a royal I-told-you-so
comes back to greet us at the beginning.
How was your trip? Oh I didn’t last
you see, folded over like the margin
of a dream of the thing-in-itself. Well, and
what have we come to? A paper-thin past,
just so, and ‘tis pity. We regurgitate
old anthems and what has come to pass, and why
dwell on these. Why make things more difficult
than they already are? Because if it’s boring
in a different way, that’ll be interesting too.
That’s what I say.
 
That rascal, he jumped over the fence.
I’m wiping my pince-nez now. Did you ever hear from
the one who said he’d be back once it was over,
who eluded me even in my sleep? That was a particularly
promising time, we thought. Now the sun’s out
and it’s raining again. Just like a day from
the compendium. I’ll vouch for you,
and we can go on scrolling as though nothing had risen,
the horizon forest looks back at us. The preacher
shook his head, the evangelist balanced two spools
at the end of his little makeshift rope. We’d gone too far.
We’d have to come back in a day or so.

after Tafisha Edwards



To disappear Black girls at a low volume of sustained public panic is to insinuate the inconstancy of Black girls. The disposability of Black girls who are prone to disappearance. A body bag somewhere waits with little hoopla about its lot. Absence becomes the lot of Black girls.
 
_________ will eventually accept as fact that absence becomes a lot of Black girls. In what becomes the normal day-to-day, Black girls are harder to find, _________ would think first, not that there are few attempts to find them. The question isn’t whether Black girls often go missing. If no one else, Black girls miss each other.
 
_________  would be remiss to not recognize how everything is made less in the absence of Black girls, if _________ could miss what _________ have never been required to recognize, such as:
 
Unlike missing Black girls, taking Black girls is a Western custom. It seems likely that such a statement will soon appear inaccurate: the white space in new textbook editions will have nothing to say about it, if the white spaces behind those textbooks have anything to say about it. That Black girls are quintessential American palimpsests is not a question but an anxiety. _________ would rather forget that Black girls were made receptacles for what the authors of Liberty and Independence would not speak. That Liberty and Independence were imaginable only in the absent-presence of taken Black girls, enslaved Black girls, Black girls on whom a foundational economic system so depended that white men would kill each other and take taken Black girls.
 
The constancy of Black girls is someone’s anxiety. The soil is thick with hidden Black girls, the myth that only quiet Black girls are worthwhile Black girls. The soil turns as _________  turn away from loud Black girls and their cacophonic insistence on Black girls.
 
_________ have not insisted enough upon the fact of Black girls, are often loudly shocked to find Black girls disappeared. Loud, unsustainable shock has a way of disappearing Black girls. Outrage, too, has a way of being disappeared.

The first step is to stop just beyond the weight of organs.
The sense of gravity sitting in tissue is like the space between
carcass and curb, before the reek worms into rock pores:
a sleeplessness there, that continual niche-trash. You too
 
once knew what it was to feel impressive. As the bed dissolves
into the walls, the walls disrobe themselves of their edges
and your resolve is now acute in the locking jaw of darkness.
Beg to be let. You, like bravery, leave behind the breath-inflated
 
lump, its depths, and its refusal to lace the cells of scars over even
the metaphorical guttings. To manage the act exceeds the box-
and-whisker of lately’s along-going. You’ve grown so accustomed
to mereness that what you call a life no longer houses the sublime.
 
It seems easy to leave. It seems this easy to leave. After
a second you’ll want to consider the centimeters of resistance
stitching air between here and all of elsewhere. But, still,
inhabit the bodiless second. To possess it is a bearable joy.

Let the blood if your belly must have it, but let it
not be of me and mine. Let my momma sleep.
Let her pray. Let them eat. Let the reverend’s
devil pass over me. Let the odds at least
acknowledge us. Let the breasts be intact,
the insulin faithfully not far, and let the deep
red pinpoint puddle its urgency on a pricked
fingertip. Let the nurse find the vein the first time.
 
Let the kerosene flow and let my grandma praise
her bedside lord for letting her miss another winter.
Let me be just a little bit bitter so I remember:
Your columns and borders aint but the fractured,
the broke clean, the brownest gouges in the blades
of our great-great-great-shoulders. Let me leave
and come back when my chest opens for you wider
than your ditches did to engorge my placeless body.
 
The mosquito-thick breath in your throat coats my skin
and it almost feels as if you love me. Let the AC
drown out the TV. Let the lotion bottle keep a secret
corner til Friday. Let Ike, Wan, D-Block, all my brother’s
brothers ride through the weekend. Let the cop car
swerve its nose into night and not see none of them.
Let us smell rain. Let the breeze through an oak hymn
the promise that keeps us waking. Let the cicada
unwind while hushpuppy steam slips out the knot
of a tourist’s hand, and let him hear in it legends
of how hot grease kept the hounds and the lash at bay.

Strange to remember a visit, really not so
Long ago, which now seems, finally, past.   Always, it’s a
Kind of obvious thing I guess, amazed by that
Cycle: that first you anticipate a thing & it seems
Far off, the distance has a weight you can feel
Hanging on you, & then it’s there – that
Point – whatever – which, now, while
It’s happening seems to be constantly slipping away,
“Like the sand through your fingers in an old movie,” until
You can only look back on it, & yet you’re still there, staring
At your thoughts in the window of the fire you find yourself before.
We’ve gone over this a thousand times: & here again, combing that
Same section of beach or inseam for that – I’m no
Longer sure when or exactly where – “& yet” the peering,
Unrewarding as it is, in terms of tangible results,
Seems so necessary.
 
Hope, which is, after all, no more than a splint of thought
Projected outwards, “looking to catch” somewhere –
What can I say here? – that the ease or
Difficulty of such memories doesn’t preclude
“That harsher necessity” of going on always in
A new place, under different circumstances:
& yet we don’t seem to have changed, it’s
As if these years that have gone by are
All a matter of record, “but if the real
Facts were known” we were still reeling from
What seems to have just happened, but which,
“By the accountant’s keeping” occurred years.
Ago.   Years ago.   It hardly seems possible,
So little, really, has happened.
 
We shore ourselves hour by hour
In anticipation that soon there will be
Nothing to do.   “Pack a sandwich
& let’s eat later.”   And of course,
The anticipation is quite appropriate, accounting,
For the most part, for whatever activity
We do manage.    Eternally buzzing over the time,
Unable to live in it…
 
“Maybe if we go upaways we can get a better
View.”   But, of course, in that sense, views don’t
Improve.   “In the present moment” (if we could only see
It, which is to say, to begin with, stop looking with
Such anticipation) what is enfolding before us puts to
Rest any necessity for “progression”.
 
So, more of these tracings, as if by some magic
Of the phonetic properties of these squiggles…   Or
Does that only mystify the “power” of “presence"" which
Is, as well, a sort of postponement.

I call this the difficulty of the non-believer,
or, put another way, waking, every morning, without a god. 
 
How to understand, then, what deserves rescue
and what deserves to suffer.
 
Who.
 
Or should I say, what must
be sheltered and what abandoned. 
 
Who.
 
I might ask you to imagine a young girl,
no older than ten but also no younger,
on a field trip to a rescue. Can you 
 see her? She is lead to the gates that separate
the wounded sea lions from their home and the class.
How the girl wishes this measure of salvation for herself:
 
to claim her own barking voice, to revel
in her own scent and sleek brown body, her fingers
woven into the cyclone fence.

I hate the word, and I guess that’s why it is said?
People love to hurt one another.
It is what makes us human.
I do love dogs.
They don’t seem to be evil unless humans make them that way.
Dogs can maul and they can sniff out bombs.
They’ll get as close to you as they can while you’re sleeping.
They’ll share heat and scent in the crook of your knees.
Is there really a thing such as innocence?
I have desired from birth to live.
Daily, I wrestle the tight arms of guilt.
At the shelter, the adoption coach told us that our new dog was highly food motivated.
I have been called a bitch.
Our dog trembles when he’s afraid and the only thing we can do is wait for the fear to leave.
There’s no comforting him.
In a dream they held me down, scrawled BITCH across my chest in old embers.
They covered my head as a weapon was raised.
I had a dog who once kept me from walking into the arroyo.
She blocked my path and wouldn’t move.
I’ll never know what, or who, she saved me from.

It will be windy for a while until it isn’t. The waves will shoal. A red-legged
cormorant will trace her double along glassy water, forgetting they are hungry.
The sea will play this motif over and over, but there will be no preparing for it
otherwise. Water will quiver in driftwood. Sound preceding absence,
a white dog trailing a smaller one: ghost and noon shadow, two motes
disappearing into surf. And when the low tide comes lapping and clear, the curled
fronds of seaweed will furl and splay, their algal sisters brushing strands
against sands where littleneck clams feed underwater. Light rain will fall
and one cannot help but lean into the uncertainty of the sea. Bow: a knot
of two loops, two loose ends, our bodies on either side of this shore where we
will dip our hands to feel what can’t be seen. Horseshoe crabs whose blue
blood rich in copper will reach for cover, hinged between clouds and
sea. It will never be enough, the bull kelp like a whip coiling in tender hands,
hands who know to take or be taken, but take nothing with them: I will marry you.
I will marry you. So we can owe what we own to every beautiful thing.

Will haul this gelatinous body, will lash forward this non-form, will push this organism of gas through the gray regions.
 
A sour wind tears through the thin white hair. A wind of vinegar and henbane tears in the rustling, discarded bird-shells that were abandoned empty and fragile when the throbbing bird-boils moved on toward so-called life. Now I see the cunning needle-trees sling these clumps of heavy pouch-flesh back and forth between them: small feather-birds “fly” above my heads.
 
I haul myself, I haul myself, I haul my dragging structure along the river furrow’s muddy, sloppily overlapping slopes. I am so bitter, so wet, so the mouth smears the inside with the sweetness of the chewed-up blood-chisel. Out of this blood I am going to suck my nourishment for some time.
 
I haul, I urge my dissolved substance, slowly forward across the metal of calm stones, the hovering thread-glue’s suction toward a point in the distant middle of the perspective. Where the river’s banks will meet and like the thinnest needle of silver of liquid will drill its dark tunnel-water straight into the heart of the dying image, this moistly broken-up surface of paper to which we cling.
 
I haul I haul I touch myself, touch the skin-rind with chafed-up viscous fingers. Little mermaid from ocean foam molded–I haul my long veils, layers of elastic cartilage, of slippery, shimmering membranes, chlorophyll. The gills shudder and glow deep down in this chasm of tissue–constantly rustling, squeaking, gasping for air. This whirling, howling, desperate lack of oxygen; the scream–if it had had enough oxygen to scream and a mouth with which to scream–the scream to swallow the entire lung full of clear wind.
 
Lizards play, glitter green, blue, and red between the skin membranes of the body dress. Where does this mass end? I search inward through strata to find the core of my plasma wet from juices, to find the core of body-flesh despite the outer, surrounding flesh, the naked body’s stable surface, a kind of human here inside the bluing, plant-becoming. Something to hold on to behind the spread of the sickness of mud, fermentation. But there is nothing to grasp beneath this mantle of slippery webbed skin, burst through by a pounding net of veins.
 
I now lick my tongue against the outer claws of the fingers to tear life into the ions, to make sores bitter in the tongue’s blue ventricles. A kind of pain therefore radiates against the inner glands, a faint spasm of cheers before this, the nervous system’s last chance to communicate with the dying I. The mists smart, shimmer, the lumps of blue cobalt from the mustard gas corrode through the otherwise red shroud-clouds that drag their bellies against the river’s surface. In one of the skin-folds between the pockets of the genital dress, lizards gather in heaps of glimmering scales.
 
But time runs on time and starvation and the weakness carries me in across the gray regions. And the soul’s dark night will slowly be lowered through me. That is why I now slowly fold myself like a muscle against the wet clay to press the flesh against the sleep-gland’s mouths. I will sleep now in my bird body in the down, and a bitter star will radiate eternally above the glowing face’s watercourse.

Up on the roof, waiting for the fireworks to begin
in warm winter rain, a moment ago I stepped
from the elevator into the black air
of an almost New Year
and need a minute to catch my breath
at the spread of city open to my eye.
I can't go to the edge; I never could.
The old fear of height still troubles me,
the sensation that nothing can be under me
if I am surrounded by mist and rain
and all of the dark night air we breathe.
Even a glimpse at the treetops in the park,
with its slick crisscrossing roads that plunge
into the jumbled panorama of East Side Manhattan,
hysterical tonight with its own incandescence,
gives me the willies. I feel as if
I were standing on the deck of a showboat of a cloud
as it drifts down some dark river, waiting for it
to bang into some other building's fifteenth floor.
How can these old people hunch the railing,
hoisting their plastic glasses of champagne
from under dripping umbrellas, as if
they drank the rain as they laugh
their analyses of the weather?
Maybe now, like me, they have nothing to lose.
I moved in three weeks ago; this is my first trip
to the roof. I don't want to die tonight,
the first fatality of 1990! There's too much of me
I left in pieces last year, oh, the whole last decade:
But I'm up here to distract myself, temporarily,
from what I don't want or can't have
in the way of love. . . . That must be
the Triborough Bridge, tied in its strings
of blue lights, and I can see in Central Park
the skating rink, like a scoured mirror below,
where some madman waves a red lantern; he
must be drunk. I have only sipped a speck of Drambuie,
which I didn't carry in my Coca-Cola glass
up to these festivities. This is the first New Year's
I've spent alone in twenty, twenty-two years.
I never could go to the edge; but I did.
Out there in the dark: my marriage, the woman
I loved badly, as she did me, or none too well;
the places we lived; the apartment I once half-owned;
the thousands of books I had to leave behind
(though I am to be granted library privileges)
and the black and white cat I really miss.
My wife's with her friends tonight somewhere in Brooklyn;
friends of mine out there, too, though I don't know
where. It's just like me to move in the middle
of a telephone company strike. Thus, no calls
from anyone—and I don't even have
a telephone yet, so who could call? Damp but trying
to smile, I eye the revelers. Two young men
and their enormous girlfriends have joined us,
really large women who carry balloons, all ready
to froth in merry champagne. We check
our watches to the screams from swarms
of apartment windows to the west
as the sky lights up with the first furious
bombardment of colored shells. I can see that
red lantern swinging toward the rockets—aha!
So it wasn't a drunk, but the fireworks engineer
preparing to blow the year's last sky
to smithereens for our delight!
I like to follow the tiny spurts of flame
from the launching pad in their heavenward trajectory
as much as I like the rockets' red glare,
the bombs bursting in air, which give proof
to the night that I am still here, hands
jammed in the pockets of my sodden raincoat,
face dripping with rain, hat soaked, wondering
if the skinny guy in the army jacket behind me
(who looks just like I did in the sixties)
is mumbling his way into a combat flashback
and ready to hurl me over the edge of the roof
and into kingdom come. I guess not yet. We've
survived the first blasts of spinning green,
corkscrews of spangled flame, buds of fireballs
spewed in arching gold sprays, the whistling fire-fish
that curl and howl as they flare, falling to ash.
Screaming its head off, the New York New Year enters.
I feel sad that beautiful things must die,
even shadows made of smoke and flame,
whatever I thought I had made out of my life—
music, poems, books, kisses, a little useless fame.
The army guy behind me grumbles at the haze
of rocket smoke that coils around the trees,
then tumbles up into the air toward Harlem.
That bump and thud and bump sound everywhere,
more clouds smacking each other head-on.
The flashes of the explosions are close enough
to touch if you wanted to burn your fingers
on the sky, and the glare rocks our shadows back
against the brick, as if chaos snapped
our pictures in the dark. I smile for my portrait,
curious at the New Year, smelling the acrid smoke
of the one we've just destroyed. Then I squeeze into
the tiny elevator car with the others, anonymous,
reconciled to be so, back to my little apartment
and the waiting glass of amber drink I'll raise,
only half in jest, to my new life.

For Rebecca Feldman and Brian Roessler



That's what the first line says
of the song I've been playing all summer
at the keyboard—trying to get my hands
around its dark, melancholy chords,
its story line of a melody that twists
up like snakes from melodic minor scales
that I've also been trying to learn, though
I'm no great shakes as a practicer of scales.
Come to think of it, neither am I much
when it comes to love—no great shakes, I mean.
Not that I haven't had my chances.
Twenty years married, I made a lousy husband,
half asleep, selfish, more like a big baby
than a grown man, the poet laureate
of the self-induced coma when it came to
doing anything for anybody but me.
""Now and then he took his thumb
out of his mouth to write an ode to
or a haiku about the thumb he sucked all day.""
That's what I imagined my ex-wife said
to our therapist near the end. She did say:
""It's all about Bill."" She was right.
And suddenly it frightens me, remembering
how, at our wedding, our poet friends
read poems of (mostly) utter depression
to salute us. I wondered if their griefs in love
had double-crossed our union, if strange
snakes in the grass of our blissful Eden
had hissed at us, and now I worry,
on your wedding day, if I'm not
doing the same damned thing . . . .
I haven't come to spring up and put my curse
on your bliss. Here's what I want to say:
You're young. You don’t know what love is.
And as the next line of the song goes, you won't
—""Until you know the meaning of the blues.""
Darlings, the blues will come (though not
often, I hope) to raise their fiery swords
against your paradise. A little of that
you unwittingly got today, when it rained
and you couldn't be married outside under
the beautiful tree in Nan and Alan's yard.
But paradise doesn't have to be structured
so that we can never reenter it. After
you've kicked each other out of it
once or twice (I'm speaking metaphorically,
of course), teach yourself how to say
a few kind words to each other.
Don't stand there angry, stony.
Each of you let the other know
what you are feeling and thinking
and then it may be possible
to return to each other smiling,
hand in hand. For arm in arm,
you are your best Eden. Remember
the advice the old poet sang to you
on the afternoon of August 4, 2001,
the day you got married.
May you enjoy a good laugh
thinking of him and his silver thumb
now that you've turned the key
into your new life in the beautiful
Massachusetts rain and—hey, now—sun!

                    Where X Marks the Spot
                ","
Not long after you had told me, gently,
that you still grieved for your last love,
though that had ended almost a year before,
and that you could have no intimate relationship
with me, maybe not with anyone for a time,
I stopped my fork in the air with whatever hung
on the end of it that I was eating.
My throat wouldn't swallow.
I felt weak and sick, as if it were myself
that I devoured, piece by piece, as you talked away
the hopes that I had put in your lovely face.
It was the old story coming true for me once more,
though you were hardly mine. . . .
When we finished I walked you back to your car;
I don't remember having much to say.
Why would I? Buildings drifted by,
and cars, and faces. Then we arrived at the place
where, afterwards, I would never see you again,
at a parking lot near Times Square.
There I marked the sidewalk with X's
visible only to me: ""At this place
I was lost again,"" they'd say to me
when I walked there in the future.
""Dig here and find what's left of me,
or what I left behind, where X marks the spot.""
I felt like the death's-head and crossed bones
that surmount the treasure chest.
I only felt a little like gold coins and jewels.
I have signed the City with these sphinxes
—in parks, in streets, in bedrooms,
in my own apartments. And there we stood,
you and I, hemmed in by the stitches of X's
that could not hold you to me. But X's
mean kisses, I realized, as well as
what is lost: all the kisses I couldn't give you
chalked like symbols on the sidewalk.
After all, you yourself had been marked
by loss, even in your laughter that afternoon
at the show I had taken you to. Bright-eyed
and smiling in the seat beside me, you
stole my glances with your dark, dark eyes
and your long hair. I thought that I had not been
this happy in a long time with a woman
and was ready to become even more happy,
ready to do anything that you wanted
in order to please you, to see that smile come up,
not knowing what you were soon to say to me
as we dined. And when you spoke,
I felt life fall away from me. Again I felt
that I would never be happy. I felt the words
that I had wanted to say to you leaving me, rushing
out of my chest like dead air, until I had no more words
to say. I seemed to cut and swallow my food
as if it were me myself that stuck in pieces
on the end of the fork I had raised to my mouth.
Had I been chewing on my own flesh?
Self-Pity the Devourer took me by the hand
that held the fork, and once again I feasted
on all that was dark and hopeless in myself,
in lieu of all that was beautiful, desirable,
and unattainable in you. And then
I stood beside you in the lot where you
had parked your car, with the X's buzzing
in the air, sticking themselves to you
and me and the blacktop and the cars.
When you reached out to embrace me, I
moved to embrace you in return—and then came
the part that I don't want to remember,
the part I hate: I caught a glimpse of your
face as we put our arms around each other,
and your face said everything to me about
how you had wasted the afternoon, how eager
you were to speed away in your car, a mixture
of disgust and relief that the thing would soon
be over, that I would be crossed out forever
from your life—and everything that I hated
about myself, my stupid chin, my ugly nose,
my hopeless balded head, my stuck-out ears,
my wreck of a heart, crashed over me,
spinning me into the vortex of a palpable self-hate
that I have only ever let myself feel
a little bit at a time, though it is always there

Like guns and cars, cameras
are fantasy-machines whose use is addictive.
—Susan Sontag

 



I place a photograph of my uncle on my computer desktop, which means I learn to ignore it. He stands by a tank, helmet tilting to his right, bootlaces tightened as if stitching together a wound. Alive the hand brings up a cigarette we won't see him taste. Last night I smoked one on the steps outside my barn apartment. A promise I broke myself. He promised himself he wouldn't and did. I smell my fingers and I am smelling his. Hands of smoke and gunpowder. Hands that promised they wouldn't, but did. 
This album is a stop-loss. By a dim lantern
or in the latrine
he flips through it.
He looks at himself
looking nearly as he does—
closest to himself then
as he could be, just learning
how to lean into his new body.
He suspends there
by standing order,
a spreading fire in his chest,
his groin. He is on stage

You’re posing. You’re scared.
A body falls
and you learn to step over

You tighten your laces

swings you forward,
goose-stepping pendulums

a body, God knows,
is not what makes you

that said they never would
begin finding
grenade pins around their fingers,
begin flipping through this album
with soot under their nails
you were not ready
But they issued the shovel and the rifle and you dug
But to watch you sitting there between the sandbags
But to watch the sand spilling out the bullet holes
But what did they expect
But what did they really think a sheet of metal could prevent
But I sat rolling little ears of pasta off my thumb like helmets
But it was not a table of fallen men
But my hand registered fatigue
But the men in fatigues were tired of sleeping in shifts
But you snuck into town and dialed home until you wrote your fingers
       were tired
But the code for Shiraz was down
But all of Shiraz was down
But the sheet lightning above the Ferris wheel of rusted bolts
But I am sure they are alright you wrote Well to reassure yourself
But the wind like an old mouth shaking the unnamed evergreen outside
       my window

 Operation Ramadan was an offensive in the Iran-Iraq War. It was launched by Iran in July 1982 near Basra and featured the use of human wave attacks in one of the largest land battles since World War II. Aftermath: The operation was the first of many disastrous offensives which cost thousands of lives on both sides. This one in general boosted the casualty limit up to 80,000 killed, 200,000 wounded, and 45,000 captured. In retrospect, the Iranians lacked effective command and control, air support, and logistics to sustain an attack in the first place. Saddam Hussein offered several ceasefire attempts in the following year, none of which were accepted by the Revolutionary regime. [6] [dead link]

an uncle, all dead now—props

Rain pours into every room

On the window sill,
in a plastic ice cream cup
a little plant is growing.
This is all the men want to talk about:
how an apple seed germinated
in a crack of damp concrete;
how they tore open tea bags
to collect the leaves, leached them
in water, then laid the sprout onto the bed
made of Lipton. How this finger of spring
dug one delicate root down
into the dark fannings and now
two small sleeves of green
are pushing out from the emerging tip.
The men are tipsy with this miracle.
Each morning, one by one,

The door to the past is a strange door. It swings open and things pass through it, but they pass in one direction only. No man can return across that threshold, though he can look down still and see the green light waver in the weeds.
          Loren Eiseley
A door opens in the wilderness.
People cross through it—bloused women families
 
Acquaintances friends all the ones I have loved
Sleep-walkers night-walkers each dazed and shorn—
 
Street aurous with ice, a snowfall scratched into
Moons—and everything I’d known—
 
Inside the bleak floating light of my lungs
In the capillaries of my eyes a blood
 
Glancing through the hatches—
If I said I would always be grateful
 
If I lied or touched with spite
If night is just a foamline of shadows
 
Though we were both lost—the door
Opening—the fear of being shown
 
Whole to the one who must love you still—
And stopped as if on a walk to say
 Look at that and what matters what really counts 
And I’ll tell you everything if you promise I promise
 
I stood at door and behind me heard
Snow-plows scrape against roads
 
At the center of night—unknown to yourself 
And the word I said out-loud to no one
 
That meant it was all to no purpose 
The word for the desire inside destruction 
 
For everything that can never be brought back—
Loose snow blown hard to each bank
 
And the common reel of those who
To avoid one extreme rush toward its opposite—
 
Snow blasted to piles—and never opened up to
Anything that could reach me until you reached me—
 
Which hours belonged to us
When was I unknowingly alone
 
Why did you always return to walk here a path
Behind my closed eyes shedding salt
 
Dry snowfall and sticks—still were you here
With me I might say The moon rose in the casement window 
 The red-haired boy across the street has learned to ride his bike
There are still picnics there are fountains
 
And the world I am leaving behind saysOne learns to see one learns to be kind—
 
I closed my eyes I closed my hands
I shut down the fields in my arms
 
The cattle on the plains veins ditches
Blue ravines a gray bird
 
Sailing through a poplar brake kids
Throwing snow I closed the last swinging juncos
 
Sheep wool caught on barbed wire I closed
Fumes and clear patches of sky I seized
 
The river the town I shut down
The hard muscles of sleep farmlands
 
Warming under midnight salt-lights scruff-pines
On the ridge animals scattering across slopes I closed
 
The smooth bone of evening a storm
On the hills white and noiseless spindled
 
Prairies where I was born I shut I seized
The clouds I closed in anger—fervor—ardor

Everything you thought you knew
must be relearned overnight.
 
How to walk.
Walk, not trip, over cords, 2x4s,
used coffee cups, concrete cores.
Walk, 40 pounds on your shoulder, across
rebar or a wood plank; glide,
not wobble, not look like the bounce
beneath each bootstep scares you.
 
How to dress yourself
to work outdoors all day midwinter
and keep warm, keep working, fingers moving;
or midsummer, with no hint of breasts.
 
How to climb ladders–
not a stepstool or a 4-footer–
ladders that stretch up two stories
where someone’s impatient
for that bundle of pipe.
 
How to get coffee–
hot and how they like it–to a crew
spread out 10 floors; to carry muffins
three blocks in a paper sack
through sheets of rain.
 
How to look.
To never go back empty-handed
when you’re told, Grab me a This/Thatfrom the gangbox, if all you’ve done
is move things around, poke here and there;
if you haven’t emptied out the full contents
so the journeyman won’t shame you
by finding This/That in a quick minute,
after you’ve said, We don’t have any. 
 
How to be dependable
but not predictable-provokable.
Not the lunch break entertainment.
 
How to read
blueprints,
delivery orders,
the mood on the job;
how long it’s okay to sit down for coffee;
how early you can start rolling up cords.
 
How to do well in school
from the back row
of a seats-assigned-Jim-Crow classroom
How to learn tricks-of-the-trade
from someone who does not like you.
 
How to listen, to act-don’t-ask.
To duck when someone motions, Duck! 
Or when someone tells you, Don’t talk to Zeke,
to know what they mean
so you don’t even look
at Zeke, the ironworker who’s always first out,
last in, standing there, so four times a day–
start, lunch, quit–all the workers walk past him,
like a sandbar, waves washing back and forth,
that catches debris.
 
How to pick up the phone and call your friend,
the only one of the women not at class
the night the apprenticeship director met you all
at the door
carrying the nervous rumor
that one of the women had been raped
and you all look at each other
and it wasn’t any of you five.
 
How to respond–within protocol–
when someone takes your ladder or tools,
imitates your voices on the loudspeaker,
spraypaints Cunt on your Baker staging,
urinates in your hardhat,
drives to your home
where you live alone
with your daughter
and keys your truck parked
in your own driveway.
 
Later, you’ll need the advanced skills:
how–without dislodging the keystone–
to humiliate a person, how to threaten
a person. Deftly.
So no one’s certain for absolute
that’s what happened. Not even you.

If I beg and pray you to set me free, then bind me more tightly still.
— Homer



I’m striving to be a better astronaut,
but consider where I’m coming from,
the exosphere,
a desk where the bluest air
thins to a lip. Impossible
to know the difference
from where I sit and space.
I promise I still dream
of coming back to you, settling
on your yellow for the kitchen.
We won’t fight. Let it not manifest.
Not over the crumpled bodies
of laundry. Let us not row
over the nail polish, its color,
the spilled sun. Inspiration
is the deadliest radiation.
It never completely leaves the bones.
You know.From here,
there are no obstructions
but the radiant nothingness. An aurora
borealis opens
like a fish. This. To the pyramids, yes,
to a great wall. And there you are,
moving from curtain to curtain. O, to fantasize
of having chosen
some design with you.
But the moons over Jupiter. But
asteroids like gods
deadened by the weight of waiting. I remember
you said pastel
for the cabinet where the spice
rack lives. That I ought’ve picked you
up flowers when I had a chance. Daisy, iris, sun.
Red roses. Ultraviolet,
the color of love
(what else but this startles the air open
like an egg?).
I’m really trying
to be better, to commit
to memory the old songs about the ground,
to better sense your latitudes,
see the corona of your face.
Take your light
as it arrives. Earth is heavenly
too. But know that time is precious
here. How wine waits years and years to peak.
What is there to do: I’ve made love
to satellites in your name.
I’m saying I can’t say
when I’ll return. Remember me, for here are
dragons and the noble songs of sirens.
Stars that sway
elysian. Ships that will not moor, lovers
who are filled with blood and nothing
more. Who could love you
like this? Who else will sew you in the stars?
Who better knows your gravity and goes
otherwise, to catastrophe?
I’ve schemed and promised
to bring you back a ring
from Saturn. But a week passes, or doesn’t
manage. Everything steers impossible
against the boundless curb of light.
Believe I tried
for you. Against space. Time
takes almost everything
away. To you. For you.

I’d never seen the sky
when always there was you. Sincerely,

Acts of love have
material effects. For a woman
tending the sacred fire, these include
the risk of becoming
an extinguisher
of flames essential
to civic life. It is a burden
to put out
what others hold as central
to faith in coherence. Acts of faith
have material effects — a Vestal
Virgin touched by encounter
must be buried alive,
a beautiful metaphor
for shame itself, which squirms
even under all that dirt. Thus, the dead
learn too late
that devotion should be
unidirectional, a straight line
from here to suffocation. Love must not
bleed at the edges, must not meet
others in the banal spaces
of civic life. It is a burden
to personify. If Vesta’s hearth is the site
of the sacred, its material effects
are destruction: burning, consumption,
constant hunger
for more wood. Acts
of destruction have
fantasmatic effects. For a body
surviving encounter, these include
civic life, shame;
the risk of being
a proxy — tender
of the hearth belonging
to the public, by way
of the goddess, who embodies a dream
of faith in coherence. Material effects
extinguish themselves, eventually,
as when a woman
touched in the correct way
undoes the burden
of love and puts out, taking
the goddamn city in and under.

I’ve been thinking about the anatomy
of the egg, about the two interior membranes,
the yolk held in place by the chalazae, gases
moving through the semipermeable shell.
A curious phrase, the anatomy of the egg,
as if an egg were a body, which it is,
as if the egg could be broken then mended,
which, depending on your faith, broken yes,
but mended? Well. Best to start
again, with a new body, voided
from a warmer one, brooded and turned.
Better to begin as if some small-handed
animal hadn’t knocked you against a rock,
licked clean the rich yolk and left
the albumen to dry in the sun — as if a hinged
jaw hadn’t swallowed you whole.
What I wanted: a practice that reassured
that what was cracked could be mended
or, at least, suspended so that it could not spread.
But now I wonder: better to be the egg or scaled
mandible? The small hand or the flies, bottle black
and green, spilling their bile onto whatever’s left,
sweeping the interior, drinking it clean?
I think, something might have grown there, though
I know it was always meant to be eaten,
it was always meant to spoil.

This rosebush assiduously forks over
its works where most grandifloras falter,
thriving as far into the year as Capricorn.While named after a lover,
it decorates its own altarand wields an extraordinary thorn:
once I saw it catch a football

it is three-headed, like Cerberus,a hybrid drawing bloodlines from a root-ball

slightly disguised for the journey, no longer appalling.
— Rainer Maria Rilke, tr. by Stephen Mitchell



The fresco cracks cooperatively over time. Not to give a secret away
but gradually to break off keeping it. In the sky you make birds
like this, one wing longer than the other, an asymmetrical v
wedged against wind, one stroke longer than another,
never the bodies turned the same direction, each finding
its own angle, and one, in the distance,
a dot. These are the Deadly Birds of the Soul
Rilke was forced to call terrifying.
Migratory, weighing no more than a pencil.
Because every flying thing is passionate, and every flight
a posture torn from stone.
There was a time it was a theme
parents would pay an artist to realize — the face of a beloved son,
a Luca or Piero, painted onto the shoulders of Tobias,
painted into the company of Raphael. You tell yourselves
and your quiet house
no harm will come to the boy
as he goes out. A guardian, though, is not a guard. To keep safe
is subtly different from confining. Radiance can strategically
direct itself to seem like us, ready, as it were, to walk.
As a mirror goes through the appearance of requiring
subsistence, goes through the motions of a meal
whose food appears to be food.
Radiance, we know, is never quite as warm as light.
Who has not tasted the silver in sea mist?
Whosever they are, angels are the first to surface there.
You know a guardian by the silver of a river-crossing,
of a father’s filmy eyes, in gall, heart, fire,
and mostly smoke. In smoke and mostly mirror.
As, wedged between forward and backward being,
rehashing and planning ahead, presence will be specked again
with being erased, a reusable writing surface
calling down to the life without rest, the self-propelled
surveillances of sharks.

is to wake yourself inside, upturned,

tomorrow is exile. Chaos, body harp,
and painted butt music, crowd-crawl, rose
crowned to the chest, rabbit
call and playing cards    ...    listen,

Started for peopled days. In dreams
A faded, lonely promontory shed petals.
Belief exists. Cunning with its perfume
Working from youth, defiance. A phantom
Vanished. The swift surrenders, leap into
The old dead heart of lies.

Into foliage. Of what light unseen!

Will hold still without its end?

On occasion, when the mood takes him
as it so often does, he will put down
his papers, get up from his kindly old chair,
and leave for a while the sweeping beam
to sow its charitable seed — that seed which,
when falling on the ground
of a helmsman’s fertile consciousness,
ought germinate in it a cautious vigilance.
He descends then, the long corkscrew of
the stairs and opens at their base the metal door
so that he may take a closer look at what might
be beyond his tower’s environs. There he always
finds the churning world, she laps at him from
every side with no respite, and spatters him
with spray. Thanks to a certain modulation,
a tone which he adopted long ago
when he still wore shorts and buckled shoes,
there is no danger here from neither shark
nor crocodile, not in this sea stuffed as it is
like a dressing-up box with whimsy.
Indeed, were there such creatures hidden
neath the sliver-thin surface of the waves,
they’d have no teeth but only soft gray gums
and goofy grins, and they’d be giggling
knowingly at the whole thing. And so it is
that as he gazes out, he cannot help
but wonder what it is he might be warning of
with the light that turns atop his tower,
because that tower is itself in fact the only
hazard anywhere on which a ship might rip her
wooden skin and haemorrhage her lumpy
blood that’s made of all the gasping sailormen.

You recount the history of the French garden.
From above, I see tight rows of trees beside threadbare grass.
When the language teacher talks about le capitalisme:
the gesture of three fingers rubbing imaginary fabric.
I’m a tourist, vulnerable and stupid,
my legs showing, shoes practical, face red.
Together, we try to reconstruct an anecdote
whose contents have scattered. A motorcycle passes, a French police siren
you say sounds innocuous then we both laugh sourly.
I hadn’t seen a woman slap a child in some time.
A truck reversing, and the alarm that continues for hours one morning.
Porn on a handheld device, its tinny echo in a room
with bare floors and very little furniture.
Across the courtyard, this T-shirt on a hanger out the window
turns in the light breeze as if trying to look behind itself.
I’m consumed with not knowing where to buy paper, safety pins, stamps.
The window frames of that building are red, emerging from gray gables.
Enormous bumblebee at the threshold investigates the doorway, doesn’t enter.
The flies do; they’re promiscuous; they leave.
I don’t know the word for because.
So each act is disconnected from another.
I can almost imagine there are no consequences,
the days just pass, one sunny, one cloudy, someone unseen shouts, sirens
every few hours, clouds move in a solemn procession across
a wide sky staggered with chimneys,
people wait to cross the street, a large tree tosses its wig a little.
Other small trees in the courtyard flicker.
They are responsive.
The sun heats the pavement; le pavé répond.
You send me a short erotic video, you’re naked, propositioning me.
Do you act more like the coin or the water?
Across the narrow street this bird
sipping from roof puddles
seems more dove than pigeon.
Pacing, grandmotherly, she stops to look at me.
Do you just know how to love another person
like someone knew to paint those window frames red?
Most of the architecture looks floral, like a boring math problem.
The crosses that reach and reach.
Why does the scrape of the furniture when I rearrange it
sound like crass American English to me?
I slept late, now I’m watching the clouds, like clouds
in an eighteenth-century painting. Overly articulate.
Except these clouds are not trying to symbolize anything.
Where’s my dove.
I always want to go look at people.
A booth selling copies of copies of Louis Vuitton.
The small shadow the roof makes on another roof right next to it.
When my friend came to Paris she wanted to break everything.
Impeccable shoes on the impeccable feet.
Clothes so new they’re creamy, and to seem to never have to  compromise.
I feel tattered when I’m actually not.
I’m an American, I eat.
A huge decorative basket of citrus snugged beside me in the upscale bistro.
The woman from a building opposite comes down, indignant:
Who threw a pomelo into my window?
You read to me about the history of the barricade.
I picture the drab suburbs.
The shoulders and elbows of people in the museum evoke more reaction
in me than most of the paintings.
A young lithe person with live eyes tends bar, gender trouble tattooed up their arm.
I count twenty-nine sleeping bags lined up beneath the overhang
and each one inhabited.
I read to you about the history of enclosure.
Two people talking on a balcony, their black hair blowing.
One leaning over into the courtyard.
Behind the cathedral, vulgar black felt stapled in the raised flowerbeds
to mask their frames.
The river stinks, allures, as a specific person can.
A repository, a consequence, a long sentence, an ongoing story.
The generous current cut through by a party boat shouting
wooo! wooo! wooooooo! wooo!
emitting an obscene light
waving at whatever will wave back.

It was winter. The opposite of burning,
which is also burning.
My banner displayed clock parts,
a cup of wine, a worm eating its opposite head.
My motto was Try to Be Responsible,
but every new moon was a sacrificial moon.
Thirteen paving slabs were flipped into the river.
The extra light of spring threw our business
into relief. My banner displayed a sunburst,
a bloodied hand dropping a knife, and
in the other hand an avocado withholding
its stone. War would soon come but not
for us, and this became our motto, Not for Us.
Then a crime in our community led to anger.
Gossip gathered the truth into a ball;
paperwork was spoiled; a man was removed
from the yellow light of the barn.
We heard his sobs coming from the orchard,
and these were a source of comfort.
Summer roused lanterns of dust under doorways,
though a vinegar taste kept the air difficult.
Antifa angels bathed their eyes in milk,
as horses refused riders. The timid among us
signed petitions swearing that when the time came
we would know it by the rocks in our hands.
I made a banner for the protests to come
depicting the planting of milk teeth,
the burning of a noose, a stadium left empty.
Autumn was just my luck. I could not stomach
the broth I boiled, and slept badly.
Arguments I won in my head lost direction
when formed out loud. The riots continued
but quietly now, indoors.
It was a time for manifestos, though the wrongs
were too many for anything less than a lake.
Friends kept the counsel of friends.
In the yellow light of the barn we tried to write
sentences each other would like, or not desire
to alter. Together we designed a quilt depicting
the wolf taking scent, water moving quickly,
the sign of the errant cloud and alphabet,
a baby resisting sleep, a worm eating
its opposite head, only this time surrounded
by snow, which hasn’t stopped falling since
Thursday, the name we gave to our child.

Once, we were coming back
From a  fête votive in Goudargues
When, sticky with pink barbe à papa,
And queasy because
The hairpinning road through St Marcel de Careiret
Resembled the crazy-maze passage of our caroming bumper car,
We were met by a stream of sangliers — 
Wild boars — 
Dashing across the D9 near the Forêt de Cavillargues.
They pelted in a single ribbon, as I recall,
So how could we even tell what they were,
How distinguish that ruche of  shadow and wind
From any other ghost of  the district?
That year I came across
A theory about the suffix –argues
That trails behind village names all around here.

It may refer to an area of  land
Given to Roman soldiers after service in North Africa
By the praetor in Nîmes.
Cavillargues. The acres of Cavillus, perhaps.
The hairy pigs had emigrated, perhaps from the Caucasus,
And no doubt had settled the Val de Tave long before Cavillus
Arrived to begin gentrification.
He wandered from the marble steps of the Maison Carrée,
Perhaps having paid obeisance to Roman gods and governors,
Perhaps uncertain from an encounter with the local plonk,
And les sangliers came out to give him a thrill,

The difference between something and nothing,

Choice by extinction sounded ominous
to Yanks like us — we all remembered the war.
But that was just Herr Schreiff’s personal English.
We were on the same side now, building the thing,
the thing,
the VTOL fighter.What’s today? There must be
some big dates coming up, historic dates.
He’d say, Cold hands frog heart, and it became a gag
among the engineers: Soft hands wombat heart,
Sweaty hands lawnmower heart.The docs in this place
want to put in a pacemaker; I said no,
I’m not in this for the long run.
On his birthday Schreiff brought in three bottles of schnapps
and we sat around half pickled trying to do the
do the
debug the navigation. What a fright?
Patty —     Debbie —    Susan called, wanted to know
could she bring me anything. I told her, My old brain.
I used to be smart, you know?I’m assuming someone
is in charge of the dates, the historic dates.
Schreiff had worked for Heinkel during the war,
on those last-ditch plywood jet fighters
that kept disintegrating in midair
and killing their precious test pilots.
Ah Christ, look at this mess! Where’s the thing,
the thing
to call the nurse? Someone needs to deal
with those important dates, it’s allsodisorganized.

and the world is quick, barely time for a spider
to suck the juice from a hawk moth’s head

while the moth constricts until it’s thin as a stick

I sit across the table from my partner
        in the atrium of the psychiatric holding facility
                our hands churched into our laps. We are not allowed
to touch. The air between us thick as Perspex.
                        They tell me all the ways this place resembles a prison.

        In 1787,
                Jeremy Bentham conceived of what would become
                the most common prison design:
                        the panopticon.
                Intended to control prisoners through the illusion
                that they are always under surveillance.

their own life,

I plead my sentence down
in exchange for: my face, my prints, my DNA

babbles in false

The origin of the word prison
is the Latin prehendere — to take.

No one was angry

man swallowed

What if it didn’t matter how much

when you were younger, how you tried forgetting
and forgot to forgive. Something has to hold you: numbers, columns,
cards to swipe, books to shelve,
pints to pour. A life filled with fixed wings, with hard grasps,
with the grateful. What’s worth keeping?
Not the sad boy who blamed you for all the ways he was broken.
Not the man’s name on the wing, but
why not the battered wing itself. Why not the woman thinking.
Why not the river below, its lips wet, footprints animal.

Over the years they hunted,
the wayward apprentice watchmakers,
the disappointing sons who transformed
their surnames, hunted over acres
of hinges, cogs, calluses, hidden whiskey,
mustaches a breath from feral,
poured an ocean of fortune
into fabrications of brass and iron,
spent entire seasons strumming
massive harps of wire into perfect
calibrations of invisibility,
prayed to the gods of adjustable mirrors,
cursed the gods of temperamental gaslights,
broke the legs of imitators and thieves,
chewed holes in each other’s pockets,
harnessed nightmares of giant silver hoops
making endless passes over the bodies
of the dead, hoisted high a cenotaph
for hundreds of sacrificed rabbits,
breathed miles of delicate thread
into the lost labyrinths of their lungs,
all to make a woman float
to make a woman float
and none of them ever thought
of simply asking her.

Six years ago, the big museum sold eight famous paintings
to purchase, for unspecified millions,
Gustave Caillebotte’s Man at His Bath.
Now it’s hip to have a print of it,
and whenever I see one hung for decoration,
I’m almost certain that this is what Caillebotte
had in mind when he broke out the oils
in 1884: some twenty-first-century bitch in Boston
catching a glimpse of a framed reproduction,
recollecting a study about how washing oneself may induce
a sense of culpability. What I remember
is he insisted I clean before leaving. That, and he was
trying to be dreamlike. He took my jaw in his hand
and said in the next life, we’ll really be together,
and the clamp in his voice made me almost
certain he knew something I did not. Now I eat right,
train hard, get my shots. This life — I’m angling
to remain in this life as long as I can, being almost
certain, as I am, what’s after —

is romantic and recommended we each behold it alone,

After Nadia Reid



This spirit she came upon me as I slept — in such a way
my life or yours could come to be so thoroughly owned — 
she was reckless — I knew she would make me run away
with her — I said spirit, slow down — but the spirit wanted
to ride — but I am so afraid, I said — I have all this tenderness
to impart — but the tenderness is not mine to give away — 
but all your tenderness is your own tenderness, said the spirit — 
it is not, I said — why then did you give it all away? — I did
not give it away — then it is yours to give away — the spirit
riddled like this — if in her arms I read a story — if out of her
arms I had the choice to write one but I chose not — chose not
because I did not know where I was going — because my path
broke down & I had this choice — stay or split — if I knew that
were I to split one part of me would become a ghost — if I did
not know yet which part — if the voice calling me out asked me
to describe the splitting & I did — if I said it was like smoke
spiraling outwards — it was like smoke lifting off me taking on
form & leaving me — if  it was like a delicate girl I never met
but dreamed of — if it was like the flags of my youth fluttering,
far out at sea — like breathing out a breath you will never take
back in — but you know you can never take any breath back in — 
if I saw her outside of myself & mourned her like I have mourned
no other loss — if I knew it was both a miracle & the most terrible
tragedy — to open up — release a flame — watch the flame go — 
have you seen it? A flame that can ride water — she was my
daughter & if I could I would send her to you, if I sent her to you
would you take her? Listen, I ran this out of me because I knew
it would burn me down — my trainers press the ground & lift up
again — I saw myself on my back in high grass in high summer
with everything coming to me — how this ghost left me & printed
a new person all over me — I could peel her off or live like this — 
I cried — one or both will destroy me! — the spirit called it fate but
I knew it was just drama — I will never know why a good person must die — 
fate does not exist I said, but every door I opened showed yesyes yes — I shut each one & locked it — checked the locks
three times — went back & checked them again — shook them to be
sure — drew hearts round the keyholes so the spirit would know
I loved her — it wasn’t — it was never — that I didn’t love her —

What can I tell you? It was a summer that seemed to be
making history — their personal history — almost before
it began, and they stood back slightly, still in it, but
observing it, saying “the summer this,” “the summer that,”

a fountain, for example, one they walked past each day,
how abundantly it would reach upwards and yet be pouring
back down itself the whole time — all winter this fountain
had been dry, not saying a word. What more can I tell you?
Oh, everything — like how they would walk home in
the evenings when the light was soft, anything bad sliding
off them, and they would feel owned, completely owned,
in a good way, by the air, which would touch them constantly,
sometimes urgently, sometimes lightly, just to let them know
it was there, and they would think maybe this is what being
alive is, when they saw how complicated a tree was and how
it wanted them looking at it and saying this, how the color
of a particular flower at this particular moment was redder

it up and get right down inside it, if you could put your mouth
to it and become as red as that rose even, it was still redder
than that, and they wouldn’t know what to do with themselves
so they wouldn’t do anything except listen to the songs in their

How hard it is to sleep
in the middle of a life.
— Audre Lorde



We wake in the middle of a life,                    hungry.
We smear durian            along our mouths, sing soft
death a lullaby. Carcass breath, eros of  licked fingers
and the finest perfume. What is love if  not         rot?
We wear the fruit’s hull as a spiked crown, grinning
in green armor.   Death to the grub, fat in his milky
shuffle! Death to the lawlessness       of dirt! Death
to mud and its false chocolate!   To the bloated sun
we want to slice open and yolk                      all over
the village. We want a sun-drenched           slug feast,
an omelet loosening its folds like hot Jell-O. We want
the marbled fat of steak and all        its swirling pink
galaxies. We want the drool, the gnash, the pluck of
each corn kernel, raw and summer                   swell.
Tears welling up                     oil. Order up! Pickled
cucumbers piled like logs for a fire, like fat limbs we
pepper and succulent                in. Order up: shrimp
chips curling in a porcelain bowl like subway seats.
Grapes peeled from bitter bark — almost translucent,
like eyes we would rather see. Little girl, what do you
leave, leaven              in your sight? Death to the open
eyes of  the dying. Here,           there are so many open
eyes we can’t close each one.          No, we did not say
the steamed eye of a fish. No eyelids fluttering like
no butterfly wings. No purple yam lips. We said eyes.
Still and resolute as a heartbreaker.         Does this break
your heart?                                      Look, we don’t want
to be rude, but seconds, please. Want: globes of oranges
swallowed whole like a basketball or Mars or whatever
planet is the most delicious.                   Slather Saturn!
Ferment Mercury! Lap up its film of dust, yuk sung!
Seconds, thirds, fourths! Meat wool! A bouquet of
chicken feet! A garden of                   melons, monstrous
in their bulge!               Prune back nothing. We purr
in this garden. We comb through berries and come out
so blue. Little girl,                            lasso tofu, the rope
slicing its belly clean. Deep fry a cloud so it tastes like
bitter gourd or your father leaving — the exhaust of
his car, charred. Serenade a snake and slither its tongue
into yours and                           bite. Love! What is love
if  not knotted in garlic? Child, we move through graves
like eels, delicious         with our heads first, our mouths
agape. Our teeth:         little needles to stitch a factory of
everything made in China.      You ask: Are you hungry?
Hunger eats through the air like ozone. You ask: What
does it mean to be rootless? Roots are good to use as
toothpicks. You: How can you wake in the middle of
a life? We shut and open our eyes like the sun shining
on tossed pennies in a forgotten well. Bald copper,
blood. Yu choy bolts                  into roses down here.
While you were sleeping, we woke to the old leaves
of  your backyard shed and ate that and one of your
lost flip-flops too. In a future life, we saw rats overtake
a supermarket with so much milk, we turned opaque.
We wake to something boiling. We wake to wash dirt
from lettuce, to blossom into your face. Aphids along
the lashes. Little girl, don’t forget              to take care
of  the chickens, squawking in their mess and stench.
Did our mouths buckle                                at the sight
of  you devouring slice                after slice of  pizza and
the greasy box too? Does this frontier swoon for you?
It’s time to wake up. Wake the tapeworm who loves
his home. Wake the ants,                  let them do-si-do
a spoonful of  peanut butter. Tell us, little girl, are you
hungry, awake,                               astonished enough?

ran the whole gamut from oysters to soup to — well — 
boiled beef to strawberry-rhubarb pie
and a little whisky after, some of it spilled on the

there were four or five small cardboard “houses,”
both of us remembered,
the homeless had claimed to sleep in and provide
a safe place for their black plastic garbage bags,
the size of a room at the Sloane House on 34th Street
near the Pennsylvania Station where I put up
the price of a meal then for a clean pillowcase
with little or no stuffing and a cardboard
bed as stiff as metal and a cardboard
breakfast of cardboard bread and eggs and between us
we talked cardboard, shirts from the cleaners with sheets of
cardboard we drew on, cardboard soles in ruined shoes
we both wore when we were children, cardboard hats,
cardboard to lie on listening to outdoor concerts
and cardboard masks we made with scissors and crayon
for costume dances, balls is what we called them
as if we were art students in Paris about to
swim in the nearest fountain.Though what I want to
say is the bees were too busy to do us any
harm and it was packs of wild dogs, not swarms
of bees, that terrified me (Larry, too) except for one
occasion when I pushed the wrong end of an old
broom into a hive of yellow jackets on the underside
of a low-lying garage roof and an angry swarm chased
me through the yard and over a fence hating
any form of criminal intrusion, urban renewal, or
gentrification, I who couldn’t resist intrusions,
who never could, omnivorous as I was, living on
apples and bananas as well as baby lamb chops,
who ran like hell that day (Larry, too)
for we in our separate ways didn’t want to be
paralyzed then eaten by larvae, none of us dead ones did.

Outside the room where you have lived a long time
Are other rooms, another building, just like yours.
Each night a ship sails past, wider than the building, taller than the highest church.
And though the passengers would like to visit the city,
No one in the city ever boards the ship. Would you?
Each night this spectacle is seen by you.
The street surveyed,
The air inhaled.

A window, the desk, a lamp, and a chair —

What made you scared of change?
Vividly you remember a child’s body; likewise you remember a man’s.
You woke up one morning,
There you were, a stinking adult.

You’ve seen the images, to watch your body spoiling
From the inside out, your lungs, your arms,
The muscles in your face —

Clouds desire the sky, the sky the sun. The wave

And every day the land responds,Of course you’re allowed.You’re allowed to be angry, to rail,
You’re allowed to curse the God who put you here.
I’ve buried many people, old people, young people.
I’ve buried children while their parents wept beside the grave.
But I’ve also seen miracles.
Remember when they told you
You might die? You didn’t, you’re alive.
And every month since then, each minute, every second is a miracle.
What happens next you cannot know.
Is it better or worse to live longer?

                ","
it started with the first time
i opened the closet in my new
bedroom. paper flecks bursting from
behind the door. they had been waiting
all millennia. you helped
me pick them from my hair but even
weeks later we’d still find pieces
in between teeth — under tongues — 
on shoulders & lodged beneath fingernails.
you were always so gentle as you’d release
them out the window — same as you’d do
for a spider. when finished with
a rainbow it is the task of the youngest
angel to put it through the paper shredder.
he crouches in the cloud mist — taking
handfuls of the body’s remnants.
he learns not to weep after years of practice.
the first rainbow he shredded was that one
that we tried to follow in your car — 
driving around wet fallen trees — mist
rising from the asphalt. we never did get there
but we did stop for ice cream. you bit
the bottom off the cone. the sound
of the rainbow’s destruction was only a dull
static noise to us down here. i noticed
it but didn’t want to tell you. the next
time i was tearing open what looked like
a credit card offer in the mail & out
came the confetti. we had just stopped finding
it on everything — gushing like an artery
i covered my face until it was through.
mounds upon mounds of color. stole the rake
from my aunt’s shed we had used to rake leaves
in early october before the weather gave
herself over to frost. i resisted the impulse
to make the confetti into piles to leap into.
you were coming over & i wanted to be
clean. the next time we slept together
i transported myself somewhere else as you kissed me.
sat on the collarbone of the rainbow as
it was shred along with my hair. me, with the
thousand-piece body. me, getting blown
away by the first breeze. me, inhaling
the tears of the kneeling angel. i came
back to the room when you knelt,
spitting paper out of your mouth. confetti began to
pour out from behind my lips, miraculously dry.
each time i tried to apologize more came out;
you, naked on the bedroom floor trying to dispose
of the colors as they came. flow mountain spring.
flow slit neck of a pig. flash flood &
flow melted ice cream down to our elbows.
by the time it stopped your fear turned to anger.
slammed the door as you left & there i
was with all this color. i put some in my mouth
but it was too bitter too swallow.
if i don’t kiss anyone this won’t happen again — 
i can keep it a beautiful secret. routine:
each morning removing the piles of cut paper.
when you come over i sometimes find them on your
skin. you don’t notice so i kiss them off
your neck. i’m trying i’m trying.
i peel the rainbows free & roll them up like
yoga mats in the closet. the shredding has
gotten so loud — i ask you if you hear
it & you shake your head, unknowingly.
i can’t stand it — i can’t stand it.
caress this color out of me.

                ","
all the rain came down at once like a dropped bag
of aquarium pebbles. too much for the street to swallow:
all gravel & grit. i feel the saltwater rushing
in my mouth as i hit the shore — sand becoming rice.
the pot on the stove — put on the lid. we read the
back of the bag — bring the water to a boil — it
protests in the clouds. rainwater peeling open
car windows to fill the floor — make mobile your
lakes & the herons will come — don’t feed the birds rice.
my favorite summer storms are the ones
that come too fast. they remind me so much of myself:
gathering their gray hair in a bouquet to beat
against the highway. i think of the times the thunder
would toss geodes at the street until they cracked open,
about dad telling my brother & i to go upstairs
& shut the windows before the storm snuck inside.
the car prayed until it drove on water — ocean barreling
toward us like a great big whale: blueness open & mouth full
of salt. you ask if we should stir the rice & the water
hisses & spits. we often forget about the ghosts
who kneel in pots of water. there’s always a wooden spoon. i keep
mine in the glove box. taking it out, i park the car with
the four-ways on. other monsters slosh past.
we get out on the side of the road. kneeling i plunge
the spoon into the bank: chicken broth & rice.
rain warming our bodies until there’s no
mistaking us from the stove. i burn my feet getting
back into the car. our flesh turns chicken-white & tender.
somewhere in all of this i managed
to drive across the whole unknown ocean — the one
without a name that shows up only when it downpours.
makes tides that eat radar & sailors.
picks rice grains from her teeth.
the other side is not land, but soft rice steaming
& ready. our legs sink in. take a spoonful of me
before i drive home a second time. the sun emerging like
a quartered bell pepper. i’m thinking of
lying in a rain puddle with you & falling apart
into a palm full of cooked rice.

Strangled light bubbles & soaps along their jaws like melted crayons

i.m. Denis Johnson, 1949–2017



the unified field 
It wasn’t that there was anything to say
that would stop him from feeling this way — the X
of himself splayed out in space
where gravity was weakest. He and his father
and talkative mother
suffering tiny strokes that took away
this syllable from this word, that syllable
from that, all this lay
in one pan of the balance scale
while in the other there was nothing but dark matter
and the cosmic inconsequence
of his literal physical heart beating.
And then the unified field, faced with its own emptiness,
bent down to his chest as if to listen.
 
a toast to pavlov’s dogs 
Oh Leash held by a hand I can’t see, here
in the laboratory where nothing can change
and where yips and bites are fine-tuned to the pack’s mentality,
am I one of his dogs, the three-legged one that knows nothing
of my lack except for how I bark, growl,
and whine to be let in? Am I the salivating triangle
guided only by my nose that keeps me
on the move in my limping trot away from you, Leash, yanking
me back from all the filth I want to shove my nose in?
Why won’t you let me go free? The sad gestures
of our growing intimacy is a reflex we
can’t escape or express: sometimes, emotion is just mange.
So Leash, here’s a toast to my lab pals: August, Fast One,
Pretty Little Lady, Joy, Beauty, MiLord, Clown.
 
the judgment after the last 
What would we like to see happen?
Would we like to drive nails into our hands?
Would the shame engulfing us like flame
on a computer screen make us understand
that throwing a match into the Grand Canyon
while snapping a selfie, and never once thinking
how far that match falls, is the original sin
that a donkey’s ears twitching

mission 
It’s not simply that the palm trees are on fire
but that they waver up more fire than fire,
brighter and harsher and more intoxicating
than the flames spreading ever thought of being — 
the thick black smoke turning noon to midnight
rears up in a wall that nobody can see
over or around or through even as this nobody
comes crashing through the screen
right into my living room: poor nobody! In this loneliest of times,
he tells me how much he loves me, how his lack
and mine feel somehow the same and that the flames
crawling over him have become his mission:
burning, he erects a burning house of smoke
we can neither live in or abandon.
 
sunday is never the last day of the week 
Using zip ties and Velcro to strap on a homemade bomb,
who is to blame, who should have told us
that on the far side of the screen in this Sunday calm
our generation has had its time? In that corner
where we slept together so many nights, yes, in that corner where
the bed of the dead lovers has been put out with all the other
Monday morning trash, there are always two doors
opening and closing as one of us goes out and the other comes in.
Why couldn’t we show our love for one another
the way the void dissolves into the zero? Why did the animal
grafted to the human find such satisfaction in explosions? Darkness
to darkness, ashes to ashes, the animal to the human,
why shouldn’t we take pleasure where and when we can — 
provided this is pleasure, provided that the body isn’t null.
 
last rites 
Even if the suit they dress me in for my funeral
is dry-cleaned at Perfection Laundry, then washed
and washed in the blood of the lamb, the knees
will still be muddy from kneeling down, the sleeves,
mismatched, will tell their own threadbare tale
about the breath of life breathed into tabletop dust.
What would the naked man and woman and talking snake say
about the god who no longer remembers if they’re forgiven
or not? Listening as a kid to the old stories,
there were never enough beanstalks and giants
and Jacks. Now, the pallbearers pick up my coffin,
they carry me out to the ruined cathedral where the saints’
wooden faces, frozen in their homely expressions of grace,
are shadowed by flocks of  blackbirds whirling past.
 
coda: the hunger artist as a senior citizen 
Nowadays, in my cage
in old straw, where
my brother keeper
forgets to come feed me anymore,
at last I’m fasting for its own sake,
not to break records I’ve broken
a thousand times before.
Besides, nothing could be easier
than to starve forever
if the food they keep on
giving you makes you sick.
This hunger is a moment’s
vision that will persist
in a pillar of radiant house dust.

When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best.... They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists.

where the Sox beat the Indians and a rookie named Rodríguez spun
the seams on his changeup to hypnotize the Tribe. Later that night,
Steve urinated on the door of his cell, and Scott told the cops why
they did it: Donald Trump was right. All these illegals need to be deported.

immigrant with papers, crop-picker in the fields, trader of bottles
and cans collected in his cart. Two strangers squashed the cartilage
in his nose like a can drained of beer. In dreams, he would remember

                ","



For  Jack Agüeros (1934–2014)



I was eight when the blackout struck and the lights died all across the city
like a massacre of fireflies. In the projects of Brooklyn, I steered myself
to 14F, fingers spread against the cool tiles of the hallway, past the concrete
and chicken-wire terrace where I once burnt ants with a magnifying glass.
Many years later, at the Chinese restaurant uptown, Jack said: They got any flan here? He was my first poet. I had seen the fireflies in his sonnets
blink and float away: Fulano the philosopher in the unemployment line;
Blanco the painter, painting in the madhouse; Monterosa the dealer killed
by shotgun in a bar on Avenue A; his mother the seamstress and the quick
needle of her sewing machine; Jack the moving man, his hands sliced raw.
He stacked his apartment with dictionaries in three languages. I knew
the raconteur’s grin with every tale: Raúl Juliá is a friend of mine:a Puerto Rican playing Macbeth. He took 14 curtain calls on opening night.
Maybe he would tell me now that flan was not Puerto Rican, or Mexican,
or Spanish, but Chinese, invented by a trembling cook to satisfy the palate
of an emperor in the Ming Dynasty. No flan, Jack, I said. This is a Chinese restaurant. Two minutes later, he said: They got any flan? I showed him
the dog-eared and fingerprinted menu. No flan, I said. When the waiter
unfurled his pad, Jack said to him: You got flan? He sang this song for an hour.
The egg roll was not flan. The fried rice was not flan. The fortune cookie
was not flan. Can we get some flan? he said. Goddammit, Jack, I said.
The poets crowded into the bar, striding to the mic. Jack stood with poem
in hand, read the title, tilted his head and said it again, studied the page
as if the words shriveled up like ants burnt under a magnifying glass,
then sat down. I witnessed the massacre of fireflies. A few of us clapped,
not knowing what to do with our hands, staring at the sonneteer who lost
all his quatrains and couplets in the denim jacket he left on the subway,
the words of Fulano still waiting on the unemployment line: The faster you spin, the stiller you look. / There’s something to learn in that, but what?
After the diagnosis, I handed Jack a book of poems. He dangled the book
upside down like a stiff mouse by the tail, something we would sniff  behind
the refrigerator. I wanted sonnets. Jack kept singing the chorus of a song:Get me to the church. Get me to the church. Get me to the church on time. 
At the end, I leaned over Jack’s bed to read his own poem in his ear, but some
words come home after the blackout, fingers crawling on the wall. I know
what I should have said at the Chinese restaurant: Jack, let’s get some flan.
We should have braved the subway at rush hour, straphangers rocking
all the way to 14th Street and 8th Avenue, to La Taza de Oro, gone now
like Jack, for rice and beans, squid in its own ink, café con leche y flan,
Jack: a spoonful of flan for you after all the years of sonnets and bread
for me, the steam rising when your hands cracked the crust at the table.

Poverty is black ice.
— Naomi Ayala



You leave me sleeping in the dark. You kiss me and I stir,
fingers in your hair, eyes open, unseeing. You leave me asleep
every morning, commuting to the school in the city at sunrise.
The landlord’s driveway, a muddy creek, ices over hard after
the freezing rain clatters all night. Your feet fly up, your head
slamming the ground, an eclipse of the sun flooding your eyes.
You sleep under the car. No one knows how long you sleep.
You awake with a hundred ice picks stabbing your eardrums.
You awake, coat and hair soaked, and somehow drive to school.
You remember to turn left at the Smith & Wesson factory.
The other teachers lead you by the elbow to Mercy Hospital,
where you pause when the nurse asks your name, where you claim
your pain level is a four, and they slide you into the white coffin
of an MRI machine. You hold your breath. They film your brain.Concussion: the word we use for the boxer plunging face-first
to the canvas after the uppercut blindsided him, not the teacher
commuting to school at sunrise in a Subaru Crosstrek. Yet, you would
drive, ears hammering as they hammer in the purgatory of the MRI.
A week before, Isabela came to you in the classroom and said:Miss, I cannot sleep. Three days, I cannot sleep. Her boyfriend called
at 2 am, and she did not pick up. At 3 am, a single shot to the head
put him to sleep, and he will sleep forever, his body hidden beneath
a car in a parking lot on Maple Street, the cops, the television cameras,
the neighbors all gathering at the yellow-tape carnival of his corpse.
You said to Isabela: Take this journal. Write it down. You don’t haveto show me. You don’t have to show anyone. On the cover of the journal
you bought at the drugstore was the word: Dream. Isabela sat there
in your classroom, at your desk, pencil waving in furious circles.
By lunchtime, as her friends slapped each other, Isabela slept,
head on the desk, face pressed against the pages of the journal.
This is why I watch you sleep at 3 am, when the sleeping pills fail
to quell the strike meeting in my brain. This is why I say to you,
when you kiss me in my sleep: Don’t go. Don’t go. You have to go.

                    The Assassination of the Landlord’s Purple Vintage 1976 Monte Carlo
                ","
The landlord says we have to go. On the night the thermostat read seventeen
below zero, and there was no heat on the first floor, the Massachusetts State
Sanitary Code appeared in the landlord’s in-box like a spirit tapping bony
knuckles on his window, and a letter appeared in the landlord’s in-box
like a spirit scratching the words no rent in the frost on his window,
and the landlord’s mouth foamed as if he’d swallowed detergent,
and the foam froze on his beard, and the landlord’s plumber laid
twenty-four feet of baseboard on the first floor, and now we have to go.
The landlord keeps his purple vintage 1976 Monte Carlo parked at the edge
of the driveway, purple inside and out, paint job and upholstery purple,
the color of emperors. The mad emperor Caligula assassinated his cousin,
jealous of his purple cloak, and the mad emperor’s mouth foamed
as if he’d swallowed detergent, and the foam froze on his beard.
The neighbors report a moose sighting today. The moose charges from the woods,
mad as an emperor jealous of a purple cloak, sees the purple vintage
1976 Monte Carlo as another moose, and rams Caligula’s chariot with
his bristling antlers, kicking the car the way a teenager high on detergent
T-boned my leased Toyota Corolla two weeks ago, and so the moose claims
his territory, this land without a gas station or a movie theater or a pizza joint
or a doctor’s office, and gallops back into the woods, snorting foam.
Now come the hunters tracking the moose, crossbows bristling since crossbow
season is upon us, their vision blurred by a night of Red Bull and detergent,
and see the purple vintage 1976 Monte Carlo as a moose, firing volley
after volley of arrows into the windshield, and the talisman of the air freshener
hanging from the rearview mirror does not keep the glass from exploding,
and the jumper cables coiled in the back seat do not rise magically like electric
eels, and the hunters explode in a cry of huzzah, waving their crossbows
as if their arrows thumped the hump of Richard the hunchback king.
The purple vintage 1976 Monte Carlo is a dead moose, tow truck dragging
away the carcass to a round of applause in my brain. The landlord will snort
and foam, demanding to know why there is nothing left but his mutilated
vanity plate stamped with the year 1976, and I will speak to him in Brooklynese,
palms turned upward in the universal gesture of the uncooperative witness.
He will keep my security deposit, his territory without a gas station
or a movie theater or a pizza joint or a doctor’s office. I say huzzah.

I close my eyes and see him windmilling his arms as he plummets from
the Mystic Tobin Bridge, to prove me wrong, to show me he was good,
to atone for sins like seeds in the lopsided apple of his heart, but mostly
to escape from me in the back of his cab, a Puerto Rican lawyer in a suit and tie.
I hated the 111 bus, sweltering in my suit and tie with the crowd in the aisle,
waiting to hit a bump on the Mystic Tobin Bridge so my head would finally
burst through the ceiling like a giraffe on a circus train. I hated the 111 bus
after eviction day in Chelsea District Court, translating the landlords and judges
into Spanish so the tenants knew they had to stuff their clothing into garbage
bags and steal away again, away from the 40-watt squint that followed them
everywhere, that followed me because I stood beside them in court. I would
daydream in the humidity of the bus, a basketball hero, flipping the balled-up
pages of the law into the wastebasket at the office as the legal aid lawyers
chanted my name. I hated the 111 bus. I had to take a taxicab that day.What the hell you doing here? said the driver of the cab to me in my suit
and tie. You gotta be careful in this neighborhood. There’s a lotta Josésaround here. The driver’s great-grandfather staggered off a boat so his
great-grandson could one day drive me across the Mystic Tobin Bridge,
but there was no room in the taxi for chalk and a blackboard. He could
hear the sawing of my breath as I leaned into his ear, past the bulletproof
barricade somehow missing, and said: I’m a José. I could see the 40-watt
squint in his rearview mirror. I’m Puerto Rican, I said. It was exactly
5 pm, and we were stuck in traffic in a taxi on the Mystic Tobin Bridge.

To be honest, I had my first surgery when they pulled me deadfirst headfirst from between my mother’s thighs. But I don’t remember that one; the separation of my flesh from the source of all I’d known. Muddy vessel, crumbling temple.

My first ten years were mostly marked by my relentless pursuit to not look pregnant when I went out in public. One of my goals each day was to not have someone ask me in public — hopeful look in their gesturing gaze, so excited by the prospect of a coming Christmas
miracle,
“Are you    ...?”
and to have to shatter their hopes of Dream Baby, and simultaneously begin the Emotional Labor of soothing their embarrassment after hearing, “No.” Because a woman with a swollen or distended abdomen can only mean one thing. And that thing is always joyous and awaited with excited anticipation. A woman with a distended abdomen couldn’t possibly be dealing on the daily with something gone terribly awry. Couldn’t possibly be engaged in an ongoing war for her body, a custody battle for her own self. A woman’s swollen belly is everybody’s Good News, everybody’s Business.
So that’s how I spent five years in my thirties: running around evading expectations my deceptive uterus induced in family, friends, and rank fucking strangers.

Everyone is invested in policing the Black body. Yes, even you. And there’s a particularly virulent investment in the surveillance and policing of the Black Woman (née “Female”) Body.

Why are you asking me questions
The devil said since the house
You had to live in is gone
I thought you’d be happy
It sure is a hot day I said
Of course it is said the devil
Why do you think I work in town

                    The Parable of Perfect Silence
                ","
Today I woke and believed in nothing.
A grief at once intimate and unfelt,
like the death of a good friend’s dog.
Tired of the mind reaching back in the past for rescue
I praise the day.
I don’t mean merely some mythical, isolate instant
like the mindless mindfulness specialist
who at the terminal cancer convention
(not that it was called that)
exhorted the new year’s crop of slaughters
(ditto)
to “taste” the day, this one unreplicable instant of being alive.
(The chicken glistened.)
Nor do I mean a day devoid of past and future
as craved that great craze of minds and times Fernando Pessoa,
who wanted not “the present” but reality itself,
things in their thingness rather than the time that measures them.
Time is in the table at which I sit and in the words I type.
In the red-checked shirt my father’s mother used to wear
when she was gardening and which I kept
because it held her smell (though it does no longer)
there is still plenty of time.
Two murderers keep their minds alive
while they wait to die.
They talk through slots in their doors
of whatever mercy or misery
the magazine has ordained for the day — 
the resurgence of the Taliban in Afghanistan, say,
ten signs that a relationship is on the rocks.
When their communion flags, as communions will,
they rekindle it with personal revelations, philosophical digressions,
humor. This is a true story,
one of them says sometimes by way of preface,
as if that gave the moment more gravity,
asked of the listener a different attention,
at once resisted and reinforced an order
wherein every hour has its sound, every day its grace,
and every death is by design.
“Love is possible for anyone,” I hear the TV talk-show host say,
which is true in the way most things in this life are true,
which is to say, false,
unless and until the nullifying, catalyzing death is felt.
Love is possible for anyone
because it is equally impossible for everyone.
To be is to be confronted with a void,
a blankness, a blackness that both appeals and appalls.
Once known — known by the void, I mean — one has three choices.
Walk away, and unlearn the instinct of awe.
Walk along, and learn to believe that awe asks nothing of you.
Are you with me, love?
(For love read faith.)
Naked once and after a rat, my father cried, “Die, vermin, die!”
banging the broomstick over and over on the floor
so incorrigibly dirty it might as well have been the earth itself.
This is my mother’s story, though I was there, I’m told,
and no small part of the pandemonium.
We were five souls crammed into one life,
and so incorrigibly poor — or was that fear? — we all slept in one room
and shared one great big chester drawers, as we called it,
and not with irony but in earnest ignorance,
just as like meant lack, as in
“How much do you like bein’ done with your chemo?”
and just as I and every other child I knew,
before we tucked into our lemon meringue pie,
solemnly wiped the calf slobbers off.
Ah, local color, peasant levity, the language fuming and steaming
rich as the mist of rot that rises off the compost heap
(“kitchen midden,” you might hear an old Scot still say).
When do we first know? That there’s a world
to which we’ve been, not oblivious, exactly,
but so inside we couldn’t see it, who now see nothing else?
Heaven is over. Or hell.
Did you forget the rat?
It thumps and thrashes like a poltergeist inside
the chest of drawers but somehow, though my father is fast,
and though his rage is becoming real, every drawer he opens
is empty. What happens when we die,
every child of every father eventually asks.
What happens when we don’t
is the better question.
To kill a wasp on water is the peak of speed.
My brother who is other has a mind of lead.
I with my stinging griefs watch from away.
How can it be there are no adults left?
What matters here is timing, not time.
His hand is high and white above the blue.
A wasp is also atom and urge, hover and touch.
Even wings are not a clean distinction.
Down comes the slap like a rifle shot.
What vengeance can there be on blank necessity?
My brother who is other has a way.
His hand is high and white. And then it’s not.
Once when my father’s mother’s health was failing
and she found it more and more difficult to tend
to the tiny family plot at Champion, Texas,
which is less town than time at this point,
a blink of old buildings and older longings the rare driver
flashes past, I took it upon myself to salt the graves
as I must have read somewhere would work for unwanted growths.
As indeed it did.
In the months after, every Sunday when we spoke,
she thanked me for the blankness, the blackness,
(my words, of course)
this new ease I had allowed her mind.
Until one day leaning over with flowers the leached earth
opened and my eighty-year-old grandmother
tumbled right down among the bones
of the woman from whom she’d first emerged.
To see that image you have to be that sky.
It has to happen in you, that crushing calling viewless blue
that is so deeply in you that it is not you.
“O, Law’, honey, I like to died.”
You don’t climb out of poverty so much as carry it with you.
Some shell themselves with wealth.
Some get and spend, get and spend, skimming existence like a Jesus lizard.
But for those whose souls have known true want
— whose souls perhaps are true want — 
money remains, in some sense, permanently inert,
like an erotic thought that flashes through a eunuch’s brain.
In 1980 my father bought his first airplane,
a scream-proof four-seater we crammed five inside,
which he considerately slammed into a sorghum field alone.
Unkillable, he killed the next ten years with work and wives,
then bought another, and brought it down in the solitary fire
that was his aspect and atmosphere. Homes, schemes,
thirty years of savings plowed into a sign company (!)
that did not, it turned out, exist.
A hole is hard to carry.
People ask if I believe in God and the verb is tedious to me.
Not wrong, not offensive, not intrusive, not embarrassing.
Tedious.
Today I saw a hawk land on Elizabeth’s chimney.
It sat with its bone frown and banker’s breast
above the proud houses of Hamden.
Are you with me? Then see,
too, a lump of animate ash rising from the flue
(or so it seems) to be a pigeon
fluttering dumbly down
next to that implacable raptor,
suddening a world of strange relations
wherein there is no need for fear, or far,
or meat.
There was a man made of airplane parts,
one of which was always missing.
He wandered the hospital grounds in search of a rudder,
an aileron, or some other fragment
that would let him fly from this place
where he was not meant to be.
There was a woman who emitted invective
ceaselessly, dispassionately, an obscenity machine.
One timid gentleman saved Saran wrap for five full years
and every night wrought an ever-more-solid ball
with which, it turned out, he planned to bash the skull
of the first soul he saw the dawn God blessed his weapon.
(A success story, alas.)
Another man with anvil hands sat six months of nights in faith
that there would come occasion of darkness, unguardedness, and vision
sufficient to rip from its socket one of my father’s bright blue eyes.
(Ditto.)
My father moved among them like a father.
He attended and pacified, he instructed and consoled.
Late to the trade, he worked too much,
and trusted his heart, no doubt, more than he should,
but was, by all accounts, at this one thing, and despite the end, good.
For love read faith
into these lines that so obviously lack it.
For love let words turn to life
in the way life turns to world
under the observer’s eye, the swirl
of particles with their waves and entanglements,
their chance and havoc, resolving
into some one thing:
a raptor on a rooftop, say.
No power on earth can make it stay.
But is it lost or released into formlessness
when we look away?
To be is to believe
that the man or woman
who inscribed with an idiosyncratic but demanding calligraphyFuck da money — Trust no one
on the rough blanket of the residential motel
where my father spent the last two years of his rough residential life
intended the note of defiant, self-conscious (da!) humor
that left my father, whom I had not seen in years,
and I, whom years had seen grow sere, far even from myself,
erupting in laughter until we cried.
Before my good friend’s good dog died
ten times a day she pressed her forehead to his
“to confirm the world and her place in it.”
Now she won’t even say his name.
Strange how the things that burn worst in one heart
one must keep silent to keep.
Ten to one you thought of men.
The murderers, I mean.
But no. This is a true story.
There is another cell, you see,
in which a woman I have known since childhood,
and since childhood have known to be
suspended on a wire of time but nimble-witted nonetheless,
lies on the cold stone floor.
She is even more naked than they have made her.
She has killed no one not even herself.
Punishment, perhaps, or some contagion of fate, finds her here,
her hair shorn, both wrists wrapped, her eyes open,
pondering the parable of perfect silence.Remember, he said, memory is a poor man’s prison.

                    From “The Galleons”
                ","

Her story is a part of something larger, it is a part
of history. No, her story is an illumination
of history, the matchstick lit in the black seam of time.
Or, no, her story is separate
from the whole, as distinct as each person is distinct
from the stream of people that led
to the one and leads past the one. Or, her story
is surrounded by history, the ambient spaciousness
of which she is the momentary foreground.
Maybe history is a net through which
just about everything passes, and the pieces of her
story are particles caught in the interstices.
Or, her story is a contradiction, something ordinary
that has no part in history at all, if history is
about what is included, what is made important.
History is the galleon in the middle
of the Pacific Ocean, in the middle of the sixteenth
century, swaying like a drunk who will take
six months to finally reach his house.
She is on another ship, centuries later, on a journey
eastward that will take weeks across the same ocean.
The war is over, though her husband
is still in his officer’s uniform, small but confident
among the tall white officers. Her hair
is marcelled like a movie star’s waves,
though she has been too sick with the water’s motion
to know that anyone sees her. Her daughter is two,
the blur of need at the center of each day’s
incessant rocking. Here is a ship, an ocean.
Here is a figure, her story a few words in the blue void.
 
2 
Research is mourning, my friend says. Which means what,
exactly, for the things listed in the archives
as filling the galleons when they left Cebu and Manila — 
ivory objects, jade objects, copper objects,
brass objects, lacquer objects, mother-of-pearl inlaid furniture,
pearls, rubies, sapphires, bolts of cotton cloth,
silks and gauzes, crepes and velvets, taffetas
and damasks and brocades, stockings, cloaks, robes,
kimonos, bed coverings, tapestries, linens, church
vestments, rugs, blue-and-white porcelain that numbered 1,500
in one ship, wax, tallow candles, cordage,
sailcloth, musk, borax, camphor, cigars, varieties of tea,
cinnamon that was dried and powdered, 40,000 pounds of it
listed in one ship’s manifest, cloves, pepper,
nutmeg, tamarind, ginger, martaban jars from Burma,
dragon jars from China, Vietnamese jars,
Siamese jars, Spanish jars, 800 jars found with the wreck
of one salvaged ship, jars that would have
contained tar for caulking, oil, wine, bizcocho bread,
salted meats, dried fruits, lard, bacon, beans, chickpeas, lentils,
flour, garlic, cheese, honey, rice, salt,
sugar, food for months, not enough food, not enough water,
chickens, cows, pigs, up to one thousand souls
depending on whether the ship had a tonnage of 300 or 500
or 1,000 or 2,000, ships that in the 250 years
of the trade route wrecked somewhere along the way
more often than they arrived in Acapulco, sailors,
mercenaries, officers, noblemen and their entourages, priests
and missionaries, slaves that were called indios
or chinos, nails, tools, iron cask hoops, fireworks, opals — elegy?

                ","
Yael picks at their cuticles. When they speak to themself, they speak out loud. They speak to themself this morning. I think, they say, that I am coming down with wisteria. Their nail beds a bit purplish.
There’s a Caesar cipher decoder ring in their shredded wheat and, unsure of what to decode first, Yael hides it under their pillow. Yael says, Today I’ll be lonely. They need the practice.
Yael never drinks their cereal milk, pours it back into the jug. But they are thirsty. Outside of their tent, the lawn is still entirely a lawn — the neighbors kept to themselves last night, trampled none of the daffodils. A good omen. Today Yael can leave their tent without fear. Of what? The omen has no answer, it presents only the bright of things.
Yael shoves three empty bottles into their bag and heads toward the river.
 

•


The pigs are having a swim and pay Yael no mind as they submerge each bottle. Yael imagines the bubbles that shimmy out are the  bottle’s breath, that they have the power to take breath from anyone.
The hair on their arms turns golden. Then the water. Then the pigs flee. Yael looks down as Sun approaches. They were already kneeling.  Their shins disrupting the path of an ant colony’s leaf-carrying  ceremony. The ants do not bite Yael — Sun is watching, and the ants like being alive, love to feel the weight of a veiny leaf, love even more the sound their mandibles make piercing through that leaf.
Sun kicks a flowering fennel as He walks toward Yael, but forgets to change the wind’s direction. The seeds blow into Yael’s hair and up their nose. Though Yael did not see Him do it, Sun gives himself away by whining, It’s not my fault.
 

•


Sun’s whine reminds Yael of their husband, Heber. Heber whines like that when Yael wants to leave his tent. When Yael doesn’t invite him into their tent. When Yael doesn’t want to watch a movie that Heber has seen a dozen times.
It’s exhausting to be shown things, to try to enjoy a movie while also giving a convincing performance of that enjoyment. Heber ruins these screenings — he weeps before the scenes that call for weeping. He mouths each pivotal line.
So far, Yael has spent their life absorbing men’s favorites. On the rare occasion that Heber does ask to watch their favorite movie, Yael can’t remember having one. This makes Yael feel a creaking, hollow-boned kind of gloom.
This gloom opens the flaps in their brain that make them want to lie in bed all day.
Yael does not know the sound of their loudest yell. All their noises  have been practiced. Maybe this is why Sun’s whine makes their cheeks flush. The sound is a selfish one. Why should it go unpunished?
 

•


Sometimes, when they think of Heber away at war, Yael grows giddy,  presses their smile hard into their pillow until the whirling joy  subsides. But what is the mainspring of that giddiness? They try to dissect the thought:

          Heber = Giddy
                    Or
                              Heber away = Giddy
                                        Or
                                                  Heber away at war = Giddy
 
•


If Yael were to look up from the dirt, they’d see the kestrels circling above, their left talons leashed to Sun’s wrist by neon green fishing line. Taut line. No give.
Yael won’t look up.
Sun exhales and lets loose His belly. It peeks out from under His shirt. You can keep thinking of me as Sun. He’s relieved Yael is alone. I’ve been looking for a new name. His old name felt stale. Dead by comparison. Sun is perfect.I have a very important job for you, Yael, descendant of — He’d left His notes at home — Yael. Enlist in my war against the wicked and blessed shall you be above all people in the tent.
Sun doesn’t mention that Yael isn’t His first, or even His second, choice.

pretending to be a man, pretending to be a Jew

the rest of us float and bobble like space trash

no one prays before the genderless stones

— Tomas Tranströmer



One of those idle hours I did not want
To participate in “group,” when it seemed
Impossible I’d know a word to haunt
Again, or make me laugh, or spur that dream
To roam myself the ranges of the tongue;
When on that ward I thought not one aspect
Of anything, no matter how strong, strange,
Or keen, could sharpen the “blunted affect”
Even electric shock had no effect on    ...
During one such despondent interval
I read these lines from his New Directions
New collected poems, and the verbal
Sequence somehow composed the correct code
To unlock feeling: corridor, right hand,

After  Jean-Michel Basquiat



Crows
               and more crows.
One crow
               with a rat
                              hanging
               from its beak,
sloppy
               and beautiful.
Another crow
               with its wings
                              plucked
               empty.
I wanted
               so much of today
                              to be peaceful
               but the empty crow
untethers
               something in me: a feral
                              yearning for love
               or a love that is so full
of  power,
               of  tenderness,
                              the words
               fall to their knees
begging for mercy
               like tulips
                              in wind.
I don’t wear the crown
               for the times power
                              has tainted
               my body,
but I can tell the difference
               between giving up
                              and giving in.
If  you can’t, ask the crow
               that watches me
                              through the window,
               laughing as I drink
my third bottle of wine.
Ask the sound
               the tree makes
                              when the crow has grown
               disgusted
with my whining.
After years of repression,
               I can come clean.
                              I was a boy
               with a hole
other boys
               stuffed themselves into.
I have wanted
               nothing to do with blackness
                              or laughter
               or my life.
But about love,
               who owns the right,
                              really? Who owns
               the crow
who loves fresh meat
               or the crow who loves
                              the vibration
               of its own throat?
Everything around me
               is black for its own good,
                              I suppose.
               The widow,
the picture of the boy
               crying on the wall,
                              the mirror
               with its taunting,
the crows
               that belong
                              to their scripture.
Can you imagine
               being so tied to blackness
                              that even your wings
               cannot help you escape?
About my life,
               every needle,
                              a small prayer.
               Every pill, a funeral
hymn.
I wanted the end
               several times
                              but thought,
               Who owns this body, really?
God?
               Dirt?
                              The silly insects
               that will feast
on my decay?
Is it the boy
               who entered first
                              or the boy
               who wanted everything
to last?

In the old place, there was no place
that did not see me.
Wherever I went mothers whispered
about me like a Greek chorus:I heard that boy    ...    I heard that.
I was just a boy. But it was
true, what they said, that I liked
other boys, that I had stolen Sarah’s,
though he was four years older
and they were very much in love.
I made him break up with her
in a Chili’s parking lot
while I waited inside. I was
fourteen. How embarrassing
to have been fourteen, to have eaten
at that Chili’s, often. That summer
I had no taste for anything
but him. Faintly of chlorine.
When he left for college
I had no one. Sarah’s friends
stared me down at school.
I found it was better,
if I could not be no one,
to be someone. Small, but
particular. Specified, which was
an apprenticeship for special.
Cold, another word for cool.

baby, meaning untidy, confusing, monumental,
great in size, and also, of or serving
as a monument, which leads me to reconsider

                                                   Danger, can you feel

For Hasna Henna and the Rohingya



Lice? My aunt once drew a comb through my hair steady;
she wouldn’t let what feeds on blood eat my inner tree.
Where now is the word for such intimacy? I know it still,
but all I see are jungles burnt of our rarest trees.
My point is: it takes a while to say, “I am a fire hazard,” or,
“a household of rare birds” is another way to say tree.
I wrote one draft of this poem, then she died. Will I
forget her name, Hasna Henna? Let’s smell a tree;
night-blooming jasmine, o-so-heavenly! A sapling
succeeds by flourishing from a tree’s seed.
How else to perfume these needs we breathe? A sapling
of course = a small and soft tree (i.e. baby tree).
I grieve the rice she fed me off a palm leaf.
Only now can I fully marvel: how finely formed is a tree!
Someone I loved said to stop with the oceans in my poems — 
well, oceans + oceans + oceans! We drown so many trees.
(Night blooming tree = baby tree = once and future tree.)
Lately, all I think about are trees.
Read this again to replace tree with refugee.

I.M. Ché Frye



i 
Kubla Ché, dreaming of ancient
Egypt, ate his hyacinths and was
marvelous. Wherever you are is
what I’m meant to say. Before you
beauty come, Dis crouching among
the black basalt, kneading master’s
soured linen, watching (bewatched)
the great beaten gold litter borne by,
deltoids sun-dewed stone, temples
bronze & strong &     in train     in
       thrall perpetual — 
                                I am of a mind,
daddy. Like, inside the blind-white
cloth-of-gold, the scented, sweating
box she sat in (think box, lock box) — 
Phoenician forest, seeder of  known
world’s every known green: malachite,
sea-green jasper, chrysocolla, olivine — 
& outside, too, other-handed, other-
landed, in rainless, treeless Thebes, my
dark knees tendered by two lands, rubbed
bare by work & love — 
       Move the tombs to the cliffs of
Beni Hasan. Send salt from the four
lakes. She is Nefertiti, she shares
the crown, she brings the single sun.
You do not watch the sun. But in
the Deeds of  Suppiluliuma she
says she is fearful     but there is no
fear past true heresy, her beauty is
clear of the next line & the next and
that kind of  beauty is     if not
redemption the possibility of a
separate resurrection.
      (Am I not beautiful too?)
      The miners are instructed: Find a
vein, gouge it to the very end.
 
ii 
Princeling Ché, wolfling Ché, fish-
eyed prodigy, anabole, brother
mine, all-beautiful boy, who’ll turn
your pages now? The lines unfurled
before you in your sleep, who sets
them to song? I cannot. (All men
have crowns and every crown can be
broken.)
       Were your senses mixed (blood
shaking your heart — orange, with
violet veins) or did hearing alone
stay and go last, were your nostrils,
at last, unblocked, your ears, at last,
symmetrized, did you unravel
first silence    did you dream?
       Maimonides says of Abraham
it is not God he disobeys but
Elohim; that in the bureaucracy
of divine instruction the envoy
fore the eyes supersedes the voice
in the ear     did they close your
eyes, daddy?     they must have
closed your eyes (enucleate the
globe, ligate the four recti, fix in
formalin) for under the sole edict
of sound
                     the son is killed.
 
iii 
Of  your father we dare & do
not speak.
 
iv 
Wherever you are, you are not
your death. You are not your cold
body, your subclavian blood, your
spine upon the body block that
proffers up your organs, your
humors pooled with gravity — you
are abed in natron, my friend, you are
forty days not in a metal slot but
roused into the mirror world, the
eastern fields of light, the father
sun rayed gentle on the rushes &
not the prosector but the jackal
keeps your stomach & the falcon
your intestines and your heart
remains your heart is yours for you
there are no more tests of   heart.
 
v 
My friend, magnificent, across your
empty desk they go on trading base
metals & precious gems. They found
flint in feldspar caves, below the first
cataract, where single stones, actioned
by wind, can mother a dune. They trade
tin south to children of  the stars, mix
alum with deep-red alizarin to
dye, to delight them who are yet to
learn the violence of  such charm
       heart hanging in its bloodslick
chamber     heart gleaming in its
rubied darkness
                   My husband, my god,
my gold-mad son
                                               lorn
issue, dim & darling eyes flooding
with natal sand, every night flooding
my free past. What’s a queen know
of this     my babies in their sunless
cease     what’s a queen’s knees know
but milk & crystalled honey     her
throat but subtle Mareotic wine     sun
smelted to gold, disced & sledding
behind her
       the whole world’s whole life
given her to give — 
 
vi 
Look, the dreamer comes!
                     Was this what you sleep-
conceived, this equal dialogue     this
black silt talk rife in death & germ
all-mixing, estuarizing, high-banked
along the flood’s go-down? (it
lowers down its voices, the flood     it
helps me to think, blessed ram, of
death as flood     for in it all
things high & low, fair & dun, flax
& inlaid faience, free & liened &
husbanded are leveled, meet, and
proven in the engorged     the
enchafèd delta.)
       I see it now. (The trick of death
is that it keeps returning.) Lady of
all women, they call me, they are
all my children now. (Labors of
my dim life.) I will prepare each
part for them. (From the front, no
back     from behind, no face     am
I purged at last of the various
envies?)
       I will build a city for you.
      (I will build a city for you.)
 
vii 
Twenty years ago we were nineteen
and already elegiac, we were
future tensed & annealed, we were
quenched in the dark peace of
violent histories — Karnak, Babylon,
Persepolis, Byzantium — the names
alone     (quarry our bones, convey
us to Karnak)     our names we
preserved, bent to stave & strophe,
accomplishing our envy, gathering
our violence, we were altogether
desire, (only ever) all we would
be     full of  imminence     (light
first, sun later)     stayed, asituate,
unforgiving.
 
viii 
Now you are time’s but I say to you,
Ché, in full mouth: We will be perfect.
There will be a recognition. The skill
has left your fingers, the dream your
brainpan but time, too, is prospected by
work     (the lumen of the vein)     (the
schist afire through the rock) and humans,
too, may burn like candles, their spines
wicks, their feverdreams the sputting
flames — 
       Work in the shadows. We will work
in the shadows, the rest being the
madness. Naughty naughty boy. Ward
residuum. Hold to murmur, hold
to method. You see? Time breaks along
its faults, lays bare its jeweled fragments
for those who love and work. It gives
it all for free. It asks only reversion
at the end. (And like, that end whereof
we could not think     thereof  (no
questions asked) you spake & said, My
father     and you answered, Here am I,
my son)     O tell me — go, you go
first (you went first) — what reason
makes this right, what insupposable
value, what excuse but ultimacy which
all know to be the breath of evil?
       I will build a city for you.
 
ix 
About beauty they really got it, those
masters: great wonders call for great
suffering. The father straps down
his son, carves along the throat’s chalked
crease (signaling purpose), the slavers
slough off infants into sand holes
(streamlining, focusing the workforce),
the queen conceives eternal city, she
deracinates a people to upraise it
with their bowed backs, mortar it with
their warm, oxygenated blood     sunk
generations & contingency &
opportunity cost     gambling our
own lives’ great gamble: that wrong,
actioned by time, can be made
soluble in art.
                                            So,
Volchénochëk, you may be absolved — 
I tried & trying.
 
x 
Listen, I want to say something to you.
You arrived just in time. You told me
they’re not better than us, you honored
our sin, repaired my will, you were
havoc in the trees, the dense infolding
fire & its fuel at once (white fusion,
wild usufruct)     always your mind
was the Emergency, always severaled,
chording the upper & lower, equal
& bonded in appetency, bonded
always to mine.
       This is a moment of children.
Who cares who sees? (Who sees?) We
scoff at faultless entropy, we strip the
pith from the inner stalk, we count to
three. Talk me into it, daddy (the
first rolls were blank)     oxidize
this carbon black significance — heart
of water — this red hematite & blue
frit, these yellow ochres that every
child knows enflesh the unreal
sun — 
 
xi 
Put it another way: the ink gleams
for three more words before it (and
meaning) sets. In those three beats I
must be thousand-faced, entelechied,
liable, I must be totally told on — 
       in the middle of my life
a myth, a tidal mouth, I am planted
in bitter celery, in the phytolithic
matrix     all-possible clay     I sense
your slow impulsion all around me.
       Heart’s lake, calendula on my
fingers, laughter in the morning-
golded reeds (shaking the papyrus),
the scale in the wind that shakes
the reeds, deus absconditus, the only
gossip of the living, I miss you
so much.
 
xii 
Either we are eternal, with neither
end nor beginning, or we are
sprung from a single thing and
proliferative — in either case death
is not death (though time cannot but
give form to suffering). Believe
(if you must) as I must:
       In all things moment.
       In each thing everything.

She steps into La Roue de la Fortune movie theater
off the Jersey Turnpike, buys a ticket,
and so swiftly the waters roll
above her instinctual visions: Plaza, Il Piazzo,
creep of film over the sound of the wordspiano, purr, whisper across her neck,
one door opens another,
in the labyrinthine pitch to preserve
order, the expulsion from Eden, the dark
soda up her clear plastic straw, reels
of rodents, popcorn, teenage workers,
acne, blood and circulation turn to ice
inside this mechanized paradise,
where reality meets the sound of gardens
growing past their makers’ dreams,
growing strange and outrageous.
She stops to check her phone
and the phone lights up, Putin, Botox,Trump, the garden grows outward, up,
to each side, the ghosts are simply
plants who forgot to stop growing;
they groan, shriek, quake, giggle, gurgle,
stare, and point fingers at the living.I’m glad I’m in love, she thinks.

                ","
There was this bear cam
on the Internet. It was pointed at a place
called Katmai National Park, Alaska. A few years ago
my friend sent me a link to it.
I would watch it sometimes
but I never saw any bears.
Maybe it was bad luck
because my friend said she saw bears.
All I ever saw was the enormous river rushing
and the tall pines in the background doing nothing.
I mean, that was OK, of course.
I loved the sound of the river
and wind in trees and the sheer thrill
that such a sublime nothingness
could be witnessed like this.
But I wanted to see a bear.
It seemed even more thrilling to be typing
in a cubicle and suddenly out of nowhere
there’s a bear on your screen
that maybe 50 other people in the world catch
a glimpse of. Maybe they are on a break from Facebook
or filling out a spreadsheet and BOOM, a bear.
So I thought while I was writing this
that I would just check the bear cam online
and sure enough a fat bear is in the middle of the river
eating a salmon right there in the Katmai National Park.
I get up from my desk and tell my colleagues
“You guys, come here!” and my colleagues
come in my office but by the time they run in
the bear crosses the river, or pixelated
screen or whatever, salmon in his jaws
and the only thing there is the river
and trees and they say,
“Sandra, this is boring,” and walk
back to their own offices.

I was probably worst at selling weed — 
robbed weekly, used too much
of my own product, cut each bag
with a dash of oregano — 
but then I have to consider that summer
Matty asked me to help him boost cars,
his dad called me a liability — 
too paranoid to be lookout,
too shaky to use the slim jim,
didn’t even know how to drive stick — 
oh yeah, & let’s not forget
that time Mo almost lost an arm
after I convinced him to pay me
twenty bucks to stitch his wound
with fishing line instead of going
to the hospital, or that time
I convinced Aliyah to let me
tattoo a cross on her ankle
with a safety pin & a ballpoint — 
& then there’s that time I swiped
a Stentor from Carl Magee’s locker
& tried to set myself straight
by becoming a violinist,
but of course, the noise complaints,
the neighbors banging the portraits
off the walls, the boys talking shit,
calling me prodigy, fancy chink — 
& I wonder if they’re still having
a good laugh, like when they found out
I wanted to be a poet & so they glued
roses & violets to the hood of my Kia,
& so maybe I wanted, for the first time,
to prove them wrong, prove
I didn’t belong there,
& so maybe I made new friends — 
friends who wrote poems,
who sat around talking about poems,
who went to school to study poems
and lived in off-campus apartments
where I crashed on nights
I got too fucked up on white boy drugs
to drive back to the Eastside,
where, even without me, the rosin glow
of junkers trace the block, where Mandy,
three years sober, tucks the kids
into bed, where Lee,
first in his class, spray-paints
the fleet of stolen bikes gold,
where Andrew stands in the kitchen
reading the Bible in the dim light
from the microwave, where Nikki,
years later, coming home
after a double at Champps, calls
to wish me a happy birthday,
& I am, of course, too busy
to answer — somewhere in a different time
zone, at a swanky party celebrating a man
I do not know, who just won an award
for a book I have not read
& the woman who smells of citrus,
who’s been raving to me all night
about how much she admires my work,
excuses herself to use the bathroom,
leaving, in the seat beside me, her open purse.

when I step into it. The squirrels scatter, the branches
lift. Sure, I’ve hurt the ones I’ve loved
by not paying attention. Not alone — never alone
is a lesson I need to understand. It was you who said that.
It’s you still. You who says, Look! You who points
to the sky. You who tilts my chin toward the heron,
who cups the minnow in your hands,
who spots the deer miles ahead, who dulls
the world with your absence. You who says, Look!
& when I look, you are gone, replaced
by the whitetail’s hind legs, fading into the bush.

I’ve stopped asking:                                                       ¿Why?
             I’ve let a man whistle
                           from the table for more beer,
& brought it to him
                           with a smile. I’ve slapped
a man & ran
                           while he laughed — 
             atrevida.
I’ve had a miscarriage. I’ve let a man
                                       kiss me
after an abortion
                                       & comforted his hot tears.
I’ve done these things,
                                                       while other girls
work in maquilas
                           piecing together
Dell computer boards,
                                       while other girls
work in brothels,
                           & cake foundation across
their bruised arms,
                                       while other girls
                           ride the bus home alone
             at night, every night,
while other girls are found
             wearing clothes
                           that don’t belong to them, or no
clothes at all. I’ve done all of this
                                       while other girls are found
                           with puta
                                       written in blood across
their broken bellies.
             My mother used to cover
my eyes
                           when we’d walk by girls
working the corner,
             & say:
                                       See how lucky you are,not to have to work
                           like they do? I have been
             muy puta,
                                       have been called puta.Yes, I’d say, very lucky.

goodbye city. goodbye stoop. goodbye rush hour traffic plume.
goodbye feminist qpoc weed delivery group. goodbye cheap noodle
spot on the corner. goodbye drag bar next door serving the messy
deep into the dead eggplant evening. goodbye drunks screaming
about literally nothing below my window. goodbye window & all
it’s seen & forgiven. goodbye urine stains talking shit between
parked cars. goodbye stars erased from the polluted heavens. goodbyegetting my steps in. goodbye highway streaked red & white with
shipments of grapefruit trucked in by the refrigerated crateful.
goodbye angels dressed in thrifted robes. goodbye locusts — i’ll see you in a decade or so.
i’m beguiled by & guided by goodbyes : meaning go ye with god :
meaning ghost-flushed & godless : meaning guided by some guy away.
who cares who? some new charon who smiles big as a river. who
rivers big as i ferry with him toward death. the city you’re in now
will never be the city you live in again. the ferryman with his good
bile smiles good with his good will toward men. with his good
guiding arm. no need for goodbyes when i got this phone where
i can visit both my living and my dead.
good grief. what’s my root for all this avoidance? for never saying
peace to anyone’s living face? for this foolish and footloose decree?
my casual excuses for slipping out the back door before the party gets
lit? must be the  jew in me. this blood doctrine. my family who survived
what i cannot write, never said goodbye, only, i’ll see you again soon.
the stories we carried are the only country i’ll pledge my sword to, guiding
me even now toward the safety of strange men’s rooms through
cruisy city parks. exile is an heirloom. plant your sneakers in the garden
so as not to bury your children in the backyard. goodbye park bench.
goodbye best friends. goodbye graffiti at union & metropolitan that
reads godbye krewl world written moments before that poor girl leapt
out into the electric commuter dark. when god closes a door, he bolts it — 
god the comptroller : god the poorly contoured : god the slumlord.
boards up the building before you can flee the house. gone the orator.
gone the forest. gone the morgan stop bookshop before i even
moved here. everywhere was better before humans came and gave
it language. god the skyline’s remarkable this time of day — light
tricked through the carbon in the atmosphere. god even the leaves
are changing and going away. god the rivers flooded with factory
waste and the air’s been replaced with arrogance. my therapist wants
closure, but i ghost the session. i text, transition from one state
of matter to the next.
goodbye city. goodbye stoop. when i moved you were already gone.
a simulacrum. a worn photocopy of what brought us in
by the refrigerated crateful and when i return you’ll be even further
distorted, disoriented organism, a fourth mortgage, an organ exhausted
by fingers, yet still at night anyone who sleeps in you’s bathed in gold.
to all my dead, i’ll see you again soon. to all my living, let bygones be
gone by the time you take this next breath. let’s live instead here,
in this transitional state. the instant water evaporates. riding the trains
below the city.

My mother is dying of too much electricity on the brain, my father, a limp in his walk, & my macho lost his green card at a bus station. I want words split letter for letter to turn sound into wisdom on my losses.

My macho says: Your skin is the color of milk, you glow between sheets. ¿Who gives more light: me, or the luna lunera? Too much milk makes you sick — drink, drink, cascabelera.
 

•
 

I want to leave my hembra behind. ¿What are my options? She bleeds on the rug, births a litter, then hides limp bodies in kitchen cabinets.

I lied. My father is dying of too much electricity on the brain, my macho, a limp in his walk, & my mother lost her green card at a bus station. Who these losses happened to matter to no one but me. To others, my loss is only worth its sum parts.

I pour a shot to get the flies drunk. Watch their little legs stagger. I like the flies tipsy, like my macho likes me when I am glazed on the kitchen floor, begging him not to leave me.
 

•
 

Come kill me over the stove, under the running shower head, gravel my skin bloody. I am so afraid one night my macho will choke me to death, though I am not afraid of dying.

My macho says: Hembra, I imagine the woman I love when I’m with you, but you’re not that woman. I ask: Who is she? My macho says: Cállate, take off your dress. Each of   his fingers strokes death. I only want to die. So I die, una y otra vez.
