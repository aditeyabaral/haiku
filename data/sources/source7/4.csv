That sound Arvo Pärt does with one piano note
stars split, fade, wander
in cosmic expansion—
 
First responder’s genesis and torch of
metadatacrunch tumbling in a 
burnt and weedy churchyard
equal parts Lethe and lithe—
Grass, is it hollow, hallow
to wake no longer among
mortals? The woman her dress flowered
from a blown ceiling silver-rosed—
Flat plasm’s
archangel coming clear out
of sheetrock and screen
shield and spear in hand
let us do all the cooking 
if she will lead the pack, remember the route, read the waters—
After the great fire we
tread river’s late cream and flare.
We woke in a city.
Where who slew us into portions
on a block out of earth
gathered our limbs 
and we were allowed to continue 
unhunted. If “if” is the one word one is given with God 
to explain how one survived.

It was a vertical time. It was the expression, a spirit giving way onto an electric barren. We
circled and were encircled and had no cause. It was a time of the self come on in a field of
apparatuses. It was vignetted by sleep, and the sleep was in its center breached. Cold moving
through the smell of gas. The big-leafed enclosure. It was a time that clattered at the horizons,
whose recounting was already foreclosed, as in a numeral smudged in powder, as in a thin water
making of the atmosphere a disc. It was a time of guzzling. A time amid what has been kept, a
time of calendered trust, repeated appeal, erasures of flight. We begin with a weedy stem drawn
against the winter sky. Dear hierophant, our decision initialed. The muffled sound of the closet
and the machine.

I’m terrified of a number of fates,
Poisoned water under a tyrant’s wage,
Being fired for doing nothing, my parents dying,
Committing a thought like this to the page,
The splash of acid to the face
The Queens non-profit boss received
Leaving work one blue August evening. Hell’s
So eloquent and poetry’s no fate at all
Unless you count the story of the divided sea
Waiting to wash its assassins away.
Says the Pharaoh, “That’s so sad.”
But that story is less fate than news, whereas
That Queens boss? Permanently burned, the Times

Silence is the sound the knife makes
slitting the skin.
Can you identify my weakness,
a pricking sensation
and numbness in one limb?
Can you hold this tongue?
Tell me, what is the function
of meticulous courage.
You are the most yourself
when you are in the motion.
One can be quick and too quick.
I have a stomach too.
It gets hungry.
If I be of necessity
opportunity,
if there be the slightest chance of success,
why have a mind, if?
Does that scream in the night across the alley
beg an answer? Are we crowning
into the sludge of an injury and its repair?
An elephant is larger and stronger than a horse;
but it is not preferred as a beast of burden.
Strength is a wee umbrella
in the storm.
This the friction sound heard
in inspiration, expiration, or both.
For convenience of description,
blood is bright red and frothy.
Have you earned the privilege
of making mistakes?
There really is no sex in science.
The nomenclature lifts
delicate subjects up from the plane
in which language places them.
Man has more strength,
woman, more endurance.
The hands and the instruments

At the top of a hill each morning,
I wait for the bus by the donut store.
Its pink sign looks hot,
curls, like a rope, a stem to a brain.
You turn toward a jade
at the height of your neighborhood,
stop at a light in its gut.
The sun starts to seep up,
reaching all grasses and grooves of the city.
A white bus with black windows passes.
A few minutes later, the city bus arrives like a room.
It crawls warm and dull to the west edge,
breathing its heat, a few baby hands
warming wide glass.
The billboard at my stop displays a large number to call.
A man walks his sniffing dog below it,
sharp legs brushing wild onion.
At the base of the hill,
I enter my code,
push the gray gate open,
allow the worn loop of my bag
down my arm, walk to my station.
I drop the metal end of a hose
into a bucket, turn the tough faucet.
Traveling after the sound,
the cold rushes out
full force from the rubber,
breaking into itself, interrupting and filling
the round plastic space.
Hungry, I pick up the water.

after Miller Williams



This is to say we continued. As though continuing changed us.
As though continuing brought happiness as we had known.
 
On a dry field without cover, his skin blistered raw in the sun.
Not one among us came, as though he had no relations.
 
What did we say to our brother? How could we leave him alone
while soldiers guarded his corpse as though precious to them?
 
One of the women, in darkness, crept to the field where he died,
prayed for him, covered him up. Dust over what was not dust.
 
We would have ventured out with her if we had loved ourselves less.
We had to think of our children, and he was not coming back.
 
How could we live with the silence, live with our grief and our shame?
Death did not heal what he suffered. He was making demands.
 
We did not want him to be there, asking the question he asked us,
changing the sound of his name. He had embarrassed us.
 
This is the memory we carried, avoiding the thought that he remained
face down among the charred grasses, holding the earth with his hands.

    The first question is always phrased this way:
    “So. How much Indian are you?”
 
II.
    We did not live in tepees.
    We did not braid our hair.
    We did not fringe our shirts.
    We did not wear war bonnets.
    We did not chase the buffalo.
    We did not carry shields.
    We were never Plains Indians.
    We tried to ride,
    but we kept falling off of our dogs.

     A local official came to our office to ask our help with a city event. He had a splendid idea, he said. To kick off the event and show everyone in town that our tribe was still around, we should go up to the bluff overlooking the city and make a big smoke signal. Then they would know we were here.
     Who ever heard of smoke signals in the forests? I imagined us upon the bluff, lighting one of those firestarter bricks. We haven’t made fire since the Boy Scouts took over. And how would the citizens know it was us? They’d probably call the fire department.

     As they ask, they think, yes,     I can see it in her face. High cheekbones
    (whatever those are) and dark hair. 
 
    Here’s a thought: don’t we all have
    high cheekbones? If we didn’t,
    our faces would cave in.
   (But I do have a colonized nose.)
 
    I’m sick of explaining myself.

    “It doesn’t matter to my people.”

When I learned I might have cancer,
I bought fifteen white lilies. Easter was gone:
the trumpets were wilted, plants crooked with roots
bound in pots. I dug them into the garden,
knowing they would not bloom for another year.
All summer, the stalks stood like ramshackle posts
while I waited for results. By autumn, the stalks
had flopped down. More biopsies, laser incisions,
the cancer in my tongue a sprawling mass. Outside,
the earth remained bare, rhizomes shrunken
below the frost line. Spring shoots appeared
in bright green skins, and lilies bloomed
in July, their waxed trumpets pure white,
dusting gold pollen to the ground.
                                                                     This year,
tripled in number, they are popping up again. I wait,
a ceremony, for the lilies to open, for the serpentine length
of the garden to bloom in the shape of my tongue’s scar,
a white path with one end leading into brilliant air,
the other down the throat’s canyon, black
and unforgiving. I try to imagine
what could grow in such darkness. I am waiting
for the lilies to open.

Now begins the festival and rivalry of late fall,
the weird debauch and daring debacle
of frat-boy parties as students parade foggy streets in mock
processions, bearing on shoulders scrawny effigies of dead,
defeated Indians cut from trees, where,
in the twilight, they had earlier been hung.
 
""Just dummies,"" laughs our dad, ""Red Indians hung
or burned—it's only in jest."" Every fall
brings the Big Game against Stanford, where
young scholars let off steam before the debacle
they may face of failed exams. ""You're dead
wrong,"" he says to Mom. ""They don't mock
 
real, live Indians."" Around UC campus, mock
lynchings go on. Beneath porches we see hung
the scarecrow Natives with fake long braids, dead
from the merrymaking. On Bancroft Way, one has fallen
indecorously to a lawn, a symbol of the debacle
that happened three generations ago in California's hills, where
 
Native peoples were strung up. (A way of having fun? Where
did they go, those Indian ghosts?) ""Their kids perform mock
war dances, whooping, re-enacting scenes of a debacle
white folks let loose,"" chides Mom. ""Meanwhile we hang
portraits of presidents on school walls and never let fall
the old red, white, and blue. My dear brother is dead
 
because he fought in a White man's war. How many dead
Indians do they need to feel okay? This whole thing wears
on my soul."" In the dark car we go silent, and the fall
night gets chillier. In yards, blazing bonfires mock
the stars that glow palely somewhere above. A thin moon hangs
over the tule fogs. I've never heard the word ""debacle”
 
before and wonder what it means. ""What's a debacle,
Mom? "" I ask. ""Oh, honey, it's a terrible and deadly
collapse. Complete ruin."" I've noticed how the hung
Indians have their heads slumped forward. They wear
old clothes, headbands with feathers, face paint, moc-
casins instead of boots. Little do we know, this fall,
 
living Indians at Feather Falls
leave tobacco to mark that, indeed,
we're still here, lungs full of indigenous air.

We could hear her
knocking down strands of cobweb
from ceilings—sticky filaments,
sacs of eggs—as we woke most mornings
to a worm of discontent.
It lodged beneath the heart,
rubbed our frayed nerves,
gnawed at the gut, spleen,
ovaries. Filth
 
was Mom's first enemy, so each day
began with ritual cleaning: the stab
and sweep of the broom down the dark hall,
over the stained and scratched oak floors.
 
For weeks, she held her dust mop
one-handed, and with the other
cupped a hernia, while she swore
at us kids in that hard voice—a litany of our sins
and failures: sloth,
stupidity, secrecy.
 
We watched her
smash the spiders that ran, herky-jerky,
along the baseboards, while we ran, too.
 
Glaring at each other,
we gathered up the scattered
laundry, our father’s shoes,
his newspapers and tools, our books,
drawings, music, sweatshirts,
and jackets, whatever
we’d left lying around.
 
We were guilty, but good
at evasion. We cultivated
shrewish or obsessive behaviors of our own: my tough
older sister sneered and stalked out of the house
to meet her boyfriend;
my sweet younger sister
trembled and cried, comforted
by one of our many dogs.
I slammed doors, pounded them
with my fists, screamed, “Shut up,
shut up, shut up!” She couldn’t
 
leave us alone. She loved us
too much.
 
Though we were quick, she was
quicker. Her words stung.
 
We must have deserved it.

Desert heat, high clouds, and sky
the color of lapis. On this journey,
anything seems possible,
so we stop by an ancient cottonwood
to kiss. The beauty trembles,
doesn't say a word, just watches
me, so open. Small birds fly by, flock
in the shady tree above us. What
settles in her heart? What congeals?
Hope? Despair? Far off, the river churns
in its sandy banks, swallows veer, turn
in fiery air. Will these kisses seal
her to me? I her lover, she my wife?
Is all of this a dream, my whole life?

She is just this side of wonderful,
and suddenly the glamorous world
fills itself with shining and we laugh
at highway monuments that explain
how hard the trek had been for Franciscans
in the Indian wilderness, poor fellows—
conversion is the devil's own
work! Then the stones of her dream
turn up under her feet, the back
of a huge land turtle. I know
we must be circling Paradise
because the ants enter the fleshy petals
of the roadside flowers with evident
joy and purpose (oh, my dark, pretty one).

Music, my adored. When is there never
music? My accordion puffs up
with drinkable melodies. I spill
her tunes into your listening ear,
one after the other: the squeeze-box
enters the dance of the plaintive gypsy
with its hard rhythms, lilts the back-
breaking labor song the worker croons
to earth, warbles romantic notes of
dissolving borders. You melt
like a woman beneath her lover's touch.
Music is happy and pitiless when
it sets fire to combustible souls. Even
the raspy bandoneon's voice is lyric.

Sacred. Sacred. Sacred. Sacred. (Speak
in a whisper.) We slip into this
space half cognizant. The land is very
large indeed: bones of the earth
worn down, though she is a living thing.
See how she exposes her grace? Antelopes
graze on the far plain—their high,
white tails—the red soil throbs
its slow heartbeat, and the blue sky
clears so smartly, perfectly, like
radiance. Are the ancestors near?
What can we know? We decide
to wander around this prairie, mistaken
for Utes, buy commodities in little towns.
 
5
Late afternoon we head west along the willow-banked
Malheur after the long curve of the Snake River plain.
(Above the falls where the Shoshone went to pray
we soaked our feet in cold water, and I observed
the arch of her brown foot.) Rabbitbrush and sage
along the highway, juniper on far hills and bluffs.
Sundown, and dusk falls over the wide basin of land.
In Burns we eat eggs in a cafe, take a room
in the Motel 6. In the dark, I can see
her black hair, black against the pillows. Its clean
scent makes me think of corn. At dawn, I hold her
and there are kisses. Then more kisses. Then more.
The day is cold; a north wind blew last night. But
the land is open. Rain falls in showers of light.
 
6
Her hand on my thigh, my shoulder,
in my hair. She leans over to kiss my cheek.
We look at each other, smile. For miles
we travel this way, nearly silent, point
with eyes or chins at the circling hawk, the king-
fisher on the snag above the swollen
creek. One night I weep in her arms
as she cries, ""Oh, oh, oh!"" because I have touched
her scars lightly: throat, belly, breasts.
In that communion of lovers, thick sobs
break from me as I think of my love
back home, all that I have done
and cannot say. This is the first time
I have left her so completely, so alone.

Ours was a play-filled childhood; irrigation ditches ran deep
during the summers. We played in the water and dirt, then inscribed
ABCs and numbers onto the smooth ground. Our cat Polly died
of rabies; then all the pets had to be shot, some in the rib cage
as they thrashed in panic. There was a pink bruise
on my forehead from pressing against the wall. We couldn't figure
 
out how such a thing could happen. The dogs were steadfast figures
around the farm. They chased strange cars and sometimes invoked deep
panic among visitors and passersby. They had cuts and bruises
from scuffles with roaming packs. No tags were inscribed
with their random Navajo names. Snazzy was skinny; his rib cage
obvious through thin fur. He looked as if he might die
 
from hunger, but he ate like nobody's business. Who knew he would die
of rabies with the rest? The main thing was to figure
out how they contracted it, my parents said. We cried until our rib cages
ached; our eyes stayed swollen. This first loss was too deep
to even talk about. Decades later, I can finally describe
how that summer led us into a grief that felt like a bruise
 
that would last forever. But our neighbor suffered worse bruises:
their huge dog, named Dog, was the first to die
and was the cause of all this. Their home and fields are inscribed
in our memories as ""the rabies place."" Over time, they must have figured
it was too much to live down. Childhood losses run deep,
even though we are grandparents now. The memory is an invisible cage
 
of anguished sobs, gunshots, yelping howls, canine rib cages
exploding. Sometimes we reminisce and notice that the bruises
of grief have turned pale like smoothed-over scars. That initial deep
hurt was the start, we found, of how love could die
right before us, even as we watched: stunned figures
pleading for mercy, urgent prayers saying, ""Let God's scribe
 
mark this down. We've paid our dues. Our hearts are inscribed
with loss after loss."" For some reason, after everything, our rib cages
held up and continued to cradle tender hearts. They must have figured
that all the prayers and careful teachings would prevent bruises
that would weaken us. Our love for those homely animals was deep
 
and would figure in the knowledge that such bruises
aren't endless, and that our rib cages are not mere bones. One can die
from grief, so now we can describe loss and love as the Holy Twins.

For the graduates of the University of Arizona.



This morning we gather in gratitude for all aspects of sacredness:
the air, the warmth of fire, bodies of water, plants, the land,
and all animals and humankind.
We gather to honor our students who have achieved the extraordinary
accomplishment of earning doctoral or master's degrees.
We gather to honor their parents, grandparents, children,
family members, and friends who have traveled with them
on their path to success. They have traveled far distances to be here
this morning: we honor their devotion.
 
May we remember that holiness exists in the ordinary elements of our lives.
 
We are grateful for a homeland that has always thrived
on a glorious array of people and their diverse cultures, histories,
and beliefs. We acknowledge the generosity of the Tohono O'odham
in granting this land on which we learn, teach, celebrate
accomplishments, and sometimes mourn losses.
 
May we always cherish our ancestors as we prepare for the days ahead.
May we remember that we exist because of their prayers and their faith.
 
We are blessed with distinct and melodious tongues.
Our languages are treasures of stories, songs, ceremonies, and memories.
May each of us remember to share our stories with one another,
because it is only through stories that we live full lives.
 
May the words we speak go forth as bright beads
of comfort, joy, humor, and inspiration.
We have faith that the graduates will inspire others
to explore and follow their interests.
 
Today we reflect a rainbow of creation:
Some of us came from the east, where bright crystals of creativity reside.
They are the white streaks of early morning light when all is born again.
We understand that, in Tucson, the Rincon Mountains are our inspiration
for beginning each day. The Rincons are everlasting and always present.
 
Those who came from the south embody the strength of the blue
mountains that encircle us. The Santa Ritas instill in us
the vigorous spirit of youthful learning.
 
Others came from the west; they are imbued with the quiet, yellow glow of dusk.
They help us achieve our goals. Here in the middle of the valley, the ts'aa',
the basket of life, the Tucson Mountains teach us to value our families.
 
The ones from the north bring the deep, restorative powers of night's darkness;
their presence renews us. The Santa Catalina Mountains teach us that,
though the past may be fraught with sorrow, it was strengthened
by the prayers of our forebearers.
We witnessed the recent fires the mountains suffered,
and in their recovery we see ourselves on our own journeys.
We understand that we are surrounded by mountains, dziił,
and thus that we are made of strength, dziił, nihí níhídziił.
We are strong ourselves. We are surrounded by mountains
that help us negotiate our daily lives.
 
May we always recognize the multitude of gifts that surround us.
May our homes, schools, and communities be filled with the wisdom
and optimism that reflect a generous spirit.
 
We are grateful for all blessings, seen and unseen.
 
May we fulfill the lives envisioned for us at our birth. May we realize
that our actions affect all people and the earth. May we live in the way
of beauty and help others in need. May we always remember that
we were created as people who believe in one another. We are grateful,

All is beautiful again.

For Marilynn



 Nihideezhí, it was a moist June afternoon when we buried you.
The Oak Springs Valley was dense with sage, cedar, and chamisa;
and gray, green, and brown shrubs cradled the small cemetery.
The sky was huge overhead.
Your son said later, ""Did you see the sky? It was purple.
I knew it would rain,"" he said.
 
The dark Carrizo Mountains were so clear.
 
There were so many people, Sister.
Many of your friends whom we didn't know,
and your former schoolmates whom we remembered as children,
and Sister, we met many relatives for the first time.
 
We cried, not wanting to leave you in that serene place.
We hesitated, though our father, his parents, and their parents
are buried there. Our older sisters thought ahead to bring flowers for them.
They huddled quietly over their graves a few feet away.
 
Shideezhí, remember how red the sand is?
The men—your sons, our nephews, grandsons, and various in-laws—
took turns filling your grave. Their necks and arms were streaked
with dusty sweat. They kept their heads down;
their faces were damp and eyes, swollen.
 
We had to get it all out; we cried
and held each other. My granddaughters hovered near me
as if I might faint or fall unexpectedly.
 
Did you see, Sister, the way the grandchildren fed and served everyone?
They guided the grandparents and the elderly to their chairs.
Once seated, they served plates filled with mutton ribs,
potato salad, corn, thick slabs of oven bread, crispy fry bread,
and Jell-O salad. They placed the salt and pepper—that enduring couple—
before us and implored us to eat. The two delights we relished were good—
hot, strong coffee and cold, crisp diet pop.
 
We ate for you; we consumed your meal, Shideezhí.
We ate to honor the times you cooked for us—
those tasty dishes, scrumptious pastries combined with laughter,
silly childhood memories, and always teasing jokes.
Sister, I didn't know how we would make it;
it is still too much to think of you not being here.

we didn't understand while
           standing at the edge of
   some low scrub hills as if
humans were extra
   or already gone;—
 
what had been in us before?
          a life that asks for mostly
    wanting freedom to get things done
in order to feel less
          helpless about the end
of things alone—;
 
when i think of time on earth,
   i feel the angle of gray minutes
          entering the medium days

    burden of an old belief,

Shadows lengthened while we sat stuck in traffic just beyond San Rafael. Headlights had begun to flare in the cool dusk. The hum of the car's engine lulled me, and I put my forehead against the glass, looking out over a darkening landscape. We were headed to the Bishop's Ranch, a weekend retreat for Episcopal Young Churchmen in hilly country that would someday produce superlative wines with garnet hues that stain the inside of a glass. I was queasy from the lurching of the car, the stops and starts, the smell of exhaust. Though trembling with cold, I was too shy to ask the lady, the mother of one of the other girls, to turn on the heater. I imagined pale pink blossoms on the Japanese plum, apple trees laden with white flowers, and north of Sebastapol the vibrant yellow of daffodils on slender, pleated stems. That night I slept in a single bunk made up with thin sheets and blankets.
 
A warm sun the next day restored me, but in the evening, seated by the fire that crackled in the fireplace of the big lodge, I felt flushed. Our recently ordained curate (we were not to know he was gay till some years later) had asked me to bring my guitar, and now he wanted me to sing about the girl who decides to sleep next to her mother her whole life long instead of falling for an unfaithful suitor. I sang; we all sang together. Young Father W. had a wonderful tenor voice. His smile reassured me, but now I was tired and, earlier than the others, I decided to return to the dorm.
 
In that clear March night, the sky gleamed like black ink and stars blazed, bright and alive. Walking downhill, guitar in hand, I suddenly stumbled with dizziness, and the slope swam before me. “Hold on, hold on,” I told myself as I nearly fell onto the dew-slick lawn. For a moment I could sense myself floating away from my body. Back in the dorm, I crawled into bed and lay shuddering with cold, bones aching. The room seemed to spin. I wanted to be home, but the thought of facing my mother filled me with terrible dismay. I knew the blue failure notice mailed by the school would have arrived.
 
Sure enough, it lay open on the dining table when I got home the following afternoon. A Sunday fog, hardly a mist, had blown in from the bay and was gathering in the eucalyptus across the ravine. The house was steamy. A basket of clean laundry occupied a chair atop a stack of San Francisco Chronicles. Mom sat at the table sewing, but I knew she was scowling. I thought it wise to look industrious, so I began to fold towels and pillowcases. “What I want to know,” began my mother, “is whether you have any ambition? Obviously, you will never get to college. What do you expect to do with your life?” She paused, and I shrugged. “Go ahead and shrug. Do you think your girlfriend is going to take care of you? That won’t last long. And why is it you only fall in love with girls? Well, I suppose you want to be a boy.” What an unutterable failure I am. I retreated, burned by her ferocious, upright anger. “Oh, yes, I’m sure you’re sick! But you will go to school tomorrow!”
 
That night, wracked again with cold, unable to stop my trembling, I sought my parents’ bed, stood moaning till Mom woke and let me under the covers, where she tried to warm me with her body. Weeks later we learned that one of my classmates, a robust girl who shot baskets as well as any boy, had succumbed to the illness and died. That night, my mother placed her hand on my forehead–her smooth palm, her touch, gentle–and said to my barely awake dad, “Our daughter has a raging fever.” Like a miracle, I was still her child. Comforted, I slept.

What might all songs lean into?
 
               You scramble eggs one moment,
and in the next minute
 
               you're eating them
with dry toast and black coffee
 
               in silence.
 
                              On a day like any day,
your voice is not your own:
 
the grass clippings disrupt
 
a robin too large to fly
from worm to worm.
 
We don't know why we speak,
 
               but yet our voices
persist, even when void of substance—
                              like a dream you'd like
 
     to recall throughout the day,
 
but you don't or you can't
and after a week, it's gone forever.
 
Of course our voices
evolve years before our bodies—
 
our vocal cords vibrate like a heartbeat,
               senselessly. No explanation
needed.
 
Eventually all languages converge.
               Each thought falls
 
into all others. And what thought
               resists being built by words?
 
                              Perhaps fear placed us
               here in this room together:
 
a fear of fire at one point turned
into a fear of God. After that, a fear
 
of godlessness, a room
where a word before
 
               another word and another
 
word after the first
was all we had, all we could
imagine. Somehow
 
an image means
more than the object itself
but not because
 
               it's made of words. Most likely
it's because the act of creation
 
sets the mind down like a bird
               in a field
 
where the speed of the invasive cannot exist.

 If an idea exists but is never found,
then the stained-glass windows
 
will reflect nothing back to the ear.
Most days filter through the mind,
 
waiting not for movement
but for a road to be built,
 
brick by brick, word by word,
 
weariness replaced with joy,
but what is joy without the years
 
and the way they open constantly,
two or three hearts pumping a volume of blood
 
meant for just one?
 
                                   Our disbelief in the ordinary
emerges from the way we color routine:
 
leaves pile up depending on the wind,
but why pause to notice?
 
Eventually the seasons embrace
what our words will not, the illuminated day
 
just one of a thousand others,
and the names we give back to the world
 
mean ultimately little against the way
 
the sun pleads sense
from the smallest cradle of dew.

That's the poet's business, so get used to it.

Shook the box like a maraca.
 
Stood around like a dope in my punch-colored dress, clutching your box
to my chest.
 
Opened your plastic receptacle, the size of a jack-in-the-box. But instead
of gaudy stripes, your box is sober-suit blue, hymnal blue.
 
Tasted them. You've gained a statue's flavor, like licking the pyramids, or
kissing sandstone shoulders. I mean boulders.
 
Remarked to your box: ""REINCARNATION comes from roots meaning 'to
be made flesh again.'""
 
Stowed your box under my bed for a week to seed dreams in which you
advise me. (This didn't work.)
 
Opened the Babylonian Talmud at random. Read aloud to your gritty,
gray-white powder: ""There are three keys which the Holy One, blessed be
He, has not entrusted into the hands of any messenger. These are: the key
of rain, the key of birth, and the key of the resurrection of the dead.""
Worked myself up to watery eyes. Any intensity evaporated the instant I
stopped reading.

pulls out her roasting pan
climbs the kitchen counter
teeters and grabs

walks her prize outside
 
releases the creature

where the lawn peters out
where the idea that at death
something is liberated
can flap blackly away.

With all mankind and beastkind riding on the waves

Crucifix in one hand, arquebus in the other, sucking

Compost heap which they used as the foundation for
Their fortifications and other vainglorious temples.
 
Puerto Rico was arrested just as it broke out of the

Last night, I went to a gay bar
with a man I love a little.
After dinner, we had a drink.
We sat in the far-back of the big backyard
and he asked, What will we do when this place closes?
I don't think it's going anywhere any time soon, I said,
though the crowd was slow for a Saturday,
and he said—Yes, but one day. Where will we go?
He walked me the half-block home
and kissed me goodnight on my stoop—
properly: not too quick, close enough
our stomachs pressed together
in a second sort of kiss.
I live next to a bar that's not a gay bar
—we just call those bars, I guess—
and because it is popular
and because I live on a busy street,
there are always people who aren't queer people
on the sidewalk on weekend nights.
Just people, I guess.
They were there last night.
As I kissed this man I was aware of them watching
and of myself wondering whether or not they were just.
But I didn't let myself feel scared, I kissed him
exactly as I wanted to, as I would have without an audience,
because I decided many years ago to refuse this fear—
an act of resistance. I left
the idea of hate out on the stoop and went inside,
to sleep, early and drunk and happy.
While I slept, a man went to a gay club
with two guns and killed forty-nine people.
Today in an interview, his father said he had been disturbed
recently by the sight of two men kissing.
What a strange power to be cursed with:
for the proof of men's desire to move men to violence.
What's a single kiss? I've had kisses
no one has ever known about, so many
kisses without consequence—
but there is a place you can't outrun,
whoever you are.
There will be a time when.
It might be a bullet, suddenly.
The sound of it. Many.
One man, two guns, fifty dead—
Two men kissing. Last night
I can't get away from, imagining it, them,
the people there to dance and laugh and drink,
who didn't believe they'd die, who couldn't have.
How else can you have a good time?
How else can you live?
There must have been two men kissing
for the first time last night, and for the last,
and two women, too, and two people who were neither.
Brown people, which cannot be a coincidence in this country
which is a racist country, which is gun country.
Today I'm thinking of the Bernie Boston photograph
Flower Power, of the Vietnam protestor placing carnations
in the rifles of the National Guard,
and wishing for a gesture as queer and simple.
The protester in the photo was gay, you know,
he went by Hibiscus and died of AIDS,
which I am also thinking about today because
(the government's response to) AIDS was a hate crime.
Now we have a president who names us,
the big and imperfectly lettered us, and here we are
getting kissed on stoops, getting married some of us,
some of us getting killed.
We must love one another whether or not we die.
Love can't block a bullet
but neither can it be shot down,
and love is, for the most part, what makes us—
in Orlando and in Brooklyn and in Kabul.
We will be everywhere, always;
there's nowhere else for us, or you, to go.
Anywhere you run in this world, love will be there to greet you.
Around any corner, there might be two men. Kissing.

to sister walking a field
browned autumn. And when she arrives
winter has come, so the old man
rises from his chair, picks up
matches, pipes and tools, and
walks out to begin again.
 
The sculptures grow by the day,
birds in ice, recognizable
eagles, a bear who began
as a man in a moment of dance.
He does this in ice, all
winter carving at dawn,
carving at dusk.
 
And sister after walking a field
browned autumn, arrives, watches
from the east window, waits,
goes out to him in spring,
taps him on the shoulder
and points to the pools
of water he's standing over.

More than a hundred dollars of them.
 
It was pure folly. I had to find more glass things to stuff
        them in.
 
Now a white and purple cloud is breathing in each corner
 
of the room I love. Now a mass of flowers spills down my

each fresh-faced, extending delicate leaves
 
into the crush. Didn't I watch
 
children shuffle strictly in line, cradle
 
candles that dribbled hot white on their fingers,
 
chanting Latin—just to fashion Sevilla's Easter? Wasn't I sad?
        Didn't I use to
 
go mucking through streambeds with the skunk cabbage
        raising
 
bursting violet spears?—Look, the afternoon dies
 
as night begins in the heart of the lilies and smokes up
 
their fluted throats until it fills the room
 
and my lights have to be not switched on.
 
And in close darkness the aroma grows so sweet,
 
so strong, that it could slice me open. It does.
 
I know I'm not the only one whose life is a conditional clause
 
hanging from something to do with spring and one tall room
        and the tremble of my phone.
 
I'm not the only one that love makes feel like a dozen
 
flapping bedsheets being ripped to prayer flags by the wind.

Laid out on vellum, the past
is a long wound. It unfolds
five centuries later,
beneath the heavy pens of scholars.
The world shifts and spins
as the Admiral's bronze astrolabe
measures the paths between stars.
The sky is written in the sea's
uneasy mirror, and mermaids
comb their hair in the distance.They are not, he writes, so beautifulas I have heard. He dreams of his own
circuitous route to the Heavens.
God and the Crown. Both want too much.
 
II. GOVERNOR
 
At Guanahani, they swam to the caravel
bearing parrots and balls of cotton thread,
these people so unlike him they could not
not be saved.
                        Too angry to sleep,
the Governor haunts every room in his castle.
The servants whisper in their own tongue.
 
The severed hands of the Taino
wave in clear salt water,
in pink-tinted water.
They wave as the gold mines dry up,
as the Governor leaves Hispaniola in chains.
 
Mermaids, dog-headed men and women
with breastplates of copper—
They draw their bows, and arrows
cover the shore of Columbus's dream.
No, not the Taino, whom he once called in dios.

A hand waves back from a passing car, someone who knows me or remembers rising one morning when the game of who you are is played out in your mind,and around you a stadium full of fans begs youto do what you usually do in the clutch.

where my face would float
coldly in the oval. Picture a caveman
encased in ice. Good. I like how
your mind works, how your eyes
inside your mind works, and your actual eyes
reading this, their icy precision, nothing
slips by them. Even now I can feel you
hovering silently above these lines,

a lone figure kneeling in the snow.
That’s too solemn. I would like to send

numb and needled with anxiety,

too many grass blades to count,

pinging on the sidewalk. It all sounds
so industrial, there’s nothing metal
that won’t make a noise, I’m thinking every gun
should come with a microphone,
each street with loudspeakers
to broadcast their banging.

Once again, someone falls in their first falling–fall of two bodies, of two eyes, of four green eyes or eight green eyes if we count those born in the mirror (at midnight, in the purest fear, in the loss), you haven’t been able to recognize the voice of your dull silence, to see the earthly messages scrawled in the middle of one mad state, when the body is a glass and from ourselves and from the other we drink some kind of impossible water.
         Desire needlessly spills on me a cursed liqueur. For my thirsty thirst, what can the promise of eyes do? I speak of something not in this world. I speak of someone whose purpose is elsewhere.

We cry, we moan, my fear, my joy more horrible than my fear, my visceral words, my words are keys that lock me into a mirror, with you, but ever alone. And I am well aware what night is made of. We’ve fallen so completely into jaws that didn’t expect this sacrifice, this condemnation of my eyes which have seen. I speak of a discovery: felt the I in sex, sex in the I. I speak of burying everyday fear to secure the fear of an instant. The purest loss. But who’ll say: you don’t cry anymore at night? Because madness is also a lie. Like night. Like death.

conscripted from the villages.

Some half dozen years, German engineers, and hundreds of Slavic peasants.

Edward’s castles were ruins
by the fifteenth century. Not from Welsh armies,
but the rise of the middle class.

tailors, smithies, cobblers, coopers.
Drawing in the Welsh peasants.

a castle grew obsolescent.

back and forth for two dollars.

         All night I drown in your eyes become my eyes. All night I prod myself on toward that squatter in the circle of my silence. All night I see something lurch toward my looking, something humid, contrived of silence launching the sound of someone sobbing.
         Absence blows grayly and night goes dense. Night, the shade of the eyelids of the dead, viscous night, exhaling some black oil that blows me forward and prompts me to search out an empty space without warmth, without cold. All night I flee from someone. I lead the chase, I lead the fugue. I sing a song of mourning. Black birds over black shrouds. My brain cries. Demented wind. I leave the tense and strained hand, I don’t want to know anything but this perpetual wailing, this clatter in the night, this delay, this infamy, this pursuit, this inexistence.
         All night I see that abandonment is me, that the sole sobbing voice is me. We can search with lanterns, cross the shadow’s lie. We can feel the heart thud in the thigh and water subside in the archaic site of the heart.

An old woman in an apron will step out,
say, “This is the right street.”
 
In the public square, there will be no friend
from school to welcome you, no drive
to Sonsonate, city of coconuts,
 
no one to order cold Pilseners, oyster
cocktails, or convince the waitress
into dancing a cumbia or two with you.
 
Instead, at the local bar, you’ll raise
a bottle next to strangers, stub
your cigarette out on the floor.
 
You’ll watch a country ten years
after the civil war: an old man sitting
on the curb, head between knees,
 
open hand stretched out.
Everything will hurt, your hair,
your toenails, even your shoes.
 
You’ll curse dusty streets, demented
sun slowly burning the nape of your neck,
stray dogs following you to the park.
 
By nightfall, you drag yourself back to the bars,
looking for a lost country in a shot of Tíc Táck.
Against the wall, three men with their guitars.
 
When you lie on a hotel bed,
too tired to sleep, when you feel torn,
twisted like an old newspaper, blown
 
from city to city, you have reached the place.
You have begun to speak like a man
by the side of the road, barefoot.

                    Cows
                ","
After seven lean years
we are promised seven fat ones,
if the cows do not die first.
Some care must be taken
to prevent their demise
in the scrub
or the slaughterhouse.
There must be enough bones
to throw and to bury.
 
The skull of a cow,
I put it on.
There are many strewn in the field,
there has not been much rain.
I look through the eyes,
that is, my eyes replace the eyes
that death has taken.
I can see out or through.
It is not a bad fate
to be a cow,
to be, at once,
so awkward,
so full of grace,
so full of milk.
 
Everywhere the udders are full,
the teats are ready,
the mouth of the calf is soft and deep.
I would thrust my hand in it
for the wet joy of being so used.
 
My own breasts are marked
from the time the milk came in too fast;
 
I did not have time to grow
to the moment of giving.
It is fitting
that beauty
leaves such scars.
 
Milk has passed through my fingers,
has spurted through my fingers,
but not once
during these seven lean years.

This is the silence around the poem of the death of my father.

Again and again. I watched it happen. In his hospital room,
I followed his breath. Then it stopped.

Fire

Here is another silence within the poem about the burial of the fire.
 
When my father died, the rains poured down the moment I picked up the shovel of earth.
I staggered under the weight of the water.
 
Another silence please.
 
 
I have always wanted to be a woman of fire.
I will have to learn how to rain.
Gently, I will learn how to rain.
 
I have set fire to your green fields,
May I be water to your burning lands.
 
Please join me in this last silence at the end of the poem of fire.

                    Something in the Belly
                ","
I wanted to have a poem and I was pregnant. I was very thin. As if I’d lived on air. A poet must be able to live on air, but a mother must not attempt it. My mother wanted me to buy a set of matching pots, Wearever aluminum, like the ones she had. They were heavy and had well fitting lids so my suppers wouldn’t burn. My husband wanted me to give dinner parties. John F. Kennedy was running for office.
 
I sensed danger. Kennedy wasn’t against the Bomb or for nuclear disarmament. I joined SANE at its inception. Also Concerned Scientists. I spoke with Linus Pauling and encouraged my husband to help his partner organize Physicians for Social Responsibility.
 
There was a baby in my belly. I wanted to write poems. I had a crazy idea that a woman could write a real novel, the kind that shook the world. I hallucinated that a woman could be a poet, but she would have to be free. I couldn’t imagine that freedom for myself even though I could see it in Isla Negra when I followed Pablo Neruda. I could see it in the way he walked. Even if he were walking inside a dictatorship, among guns, soldiers and spies, there was nothing between him and his vision. Anything he saw, he was able to take into himself–there was no sight, no image, no vision to which he didn’t feel entitled. In his heart, everything–everything–belonged to him. Pablo Neruda was–more than anything–a poet, and so he was an entitled man.
 
I was a woman and entitled to nothing. I had nothing except a husband, a rented house, a set of pots, living room furniture, a frenzy of obligations, credit cards, anxious relatives, too many acquaintances, a gift of future diaper service, two telephones, no time to read, a plastic wrapped cookbook of recipes gleaned from the pages of the New York Times, and a hunger, a terrible hunger for the unimaginable, unlimited freedom of being a poet, and a baby in my belly.
 
I would have called Pablo long distance if I had the courage, if I had the ability to speak Spanish fluently, if we had ever talked about real things. But, what would a man know about a baby in the belly? And what did it matter if there were to be one poet more or less in the world when so many in his country were dying?
 
I woke up one morning and thought–I can’t have this child. My husband said, “You’ll have to get a job after it’s born so we can buy a house. You’ll need an advanced degree so you can do something.” I thought, I can’t. I have to write poems. My mother found a crib. Someone painted it white. A friend sent a pastel mobile with tame wood animals. I thought about blue curtains, making bedspreads, and abortions.
 
Pablo was silent. He was walking so far from me, I couldn’t hear him. My husband objected to donating more free medical care to the Black Panthers. I tried to make dolmades from scratch and located grape leaves preserved in brine at the Boys’ Market twenty miles away. I organized a write-in campaign for peace to challenge JFK. My husband thought it would be nice to have teatime with the children and romantic dinners by ourselves. The new formula bottles lined up on the sink like tiny bombs. The U.S. was pursuing over ground testing; I was afraid the radiation would cross the milk barrier. I had a poem in me howling for real life but no language to write in. The fog came in thick, flapping about my feet like blankets unraveling. I became afraid to have a daughter.
 
I called Pablo Neruda in the middle of the night as he walked underwater by Isla Negra. He moved like a dream porpoise. He seemed pregnant with words. They came out of his penis in long miraculous strings. The sea creatures quivered with joy. I said, “Pablo, I want to know how to bear the child in my belly onto this bed of uranium and I want to know if a woman can a be a poet.” He was large as a whale. He drank the sea and spouted it in glistening odes, black and shiny. I said, “I can’t have this child,” and he laughed as if he had never done anything but carry and birth children.
 
So I packed my little bag as if I were going to the hospital and I left a note and the Wearever pots and sterilized nipples upon the glass missiles, and took the cradle board than an American Indian friend had given me for the baby and that had made my husband snort– “You’re not going to carry the thing on your back, are you?” I took some money, the car, some books, paper and pens, my walking shoes, an unwieldly IBM electric typewriter, my pregnant belly and a dozen cloth diapers, and I went out.
 
I knew how to carry a baby and how to carry a poem and I would learn how to have a baby and even how to have a poem. I would have enough milk for both. I would learn how to walk with them. But I didn’t know, and I didn’t want to know, how to have a husband and a matched set of Wearever pots.

Where I seldom shopped,
Usually only after therapy
Elbow sore at the crook
From a handbasket filled
To capacity. The glossy pastries!
Pomegranate, persimmon, quince!
Once, a bag of black beluga
Lentils spilt a trail behind me
While I labored to find
A tea they refused to carry.
It was Brooklyn. My thirties.
Everyone I knew was living
The same desolate luxury,
Each ashamed of the same things:
Innocence and privacy. I'd lug
Home the paper bags, doing
Bank-balance math and counting days.
I'd squint into it, or close my eyes
And let it slam me in the face—
The known sun setting
On the dawning century.

Singing that old blood-deep song
That dragged us to those banks
And cast us in. I love you,

The swirling dust motes

What woke to war in me those years
When my daughter had first grown into
A solid self-centered self? I’d watch her
Sit at the table—well, not quite sit,
More like stand on one leg while
The other knee hovered just over the chair.
She wouldn't lower herself, as if
There might be a fire, or a great black
Blizzard of waves let loose in the kitchen,
And she'd need to make her escape. No,
She'd trust no one but herself, her own
New lean always jittering legs to carry her—
Where exactly? Where would a child go?
To there. There alone. She'd rest one elbow
On the table—the opposite one to the bent leg
Skimming the solid expensive tasteful chair.
And even though we were together, her eyes
Would go half-dome, shades dropped
Like a screen at some cinema the old aren't
Let into. I thought I'd have more time! I thought
My body would have taken longer going
About the inevitable feat of repelling her,
But now, I could see even in what food
She left untouched, food I'd bought and made
And all but ferried to her lips, I could see
How it smacked of all that had grown slack
And loose in me. Her other arm
Would wave the fork around just above
The surface of the plate, casting about
For the least possible morsel, the tiniest
Grain of unseasoned rice. She'd dip
Into the food like one of those shoddy
Metal claws poised over a valley of rubber
Bouncing balls, the kind that lifts nothing
Or next to nothing and drops it in the chute.
The narrow untouched hips. The shoulders
Still so naïve as to stand squared, erect,
Impervious facing the window open
Onto the darkening dusk.

The Inside Out Mermaid is fine with letting it all hang out–veins, muscles, the bits of fat at her belly, her small gray spleen. At first her lover loves it–with her organs on the outside, she's the ultimate open book. He can pump her lungs like two bellows and make her gasp; ask her difficult questions and study the synapses firing in her brain as she answers to see if she's lying; poke a pleasure center in the frontal lobe and watch her squirm. No need for bouquets or sad stories about his childhood. He just plucks a pulmonary vein and watches the left ventricle flounder. But before long, she starts to sense that her lover, like all the others before him, is getting restless. This is when she starts showing them her collections–the basket of keys from all over the world, the box of zippers with teeth of every imaginable size–all chosen to convey a sense of openness. As a last resort, she’ll even read out loud the entries from her diary about him to him. But eventually he’ll become convinced she’s hiding things from him and she is. Her perfect skin. Her long black hair. Her red mouth, never chapped from exposure to sun or wind, how she secretly loves that he can’t touch her here or here.

After the birthing of bombs of forks and fear
the frantic automatic weapons unleashed,
the spray of bullets into a crowd holding hands,
that brute sky opening in a slate metal maw
that swallows only the unsayable in each of us, what’s
left? Even the hidden nowhere river is poisoned
orange and acidic by a coal mine. How can
you not fear humanity, want to lick the creek
bottom dry, to suck the deadly water up into
your own lungs, like venom? Reader, I want to
say: Don’t die. Even when silvery fish after fish
comes back belly up, and the country plummets
into a crepitating crater of hatred, isn’t there still
something singing? The truth is: I don’t know.
But sometimes, I swear I hear it, the wound closing
like a rusted-over garage door, and I can still move
my living limbs into the world without too much
pain, can still marvel at how the dog runs straight
toward the pickup trucks break-necking down
the road, because she thinks she loves them,
because she’s sure, without a doubt, that the loud
roaring things will love her back, her soft small self
alive with desire to share her goddamn enthusiasm,
until I yank the leash back to save her because
I want her to survive forever. Don’t die, I say,
and we decide to walk for a bit longer, starlings
high and fevered above us, winter coming to lay
her cold corpse down upon this little plot of earth.
Perhaps we are always hurtling our body towards

The truth is, I’ve never cared for the National
Anthem. If you think about it, it’s not a good
song. Too high for most of us with “the rockets
red glare” and then there are the bombs.
(Always, always, there is war and bombs.)
Once, I sang it at homecoming and threw
even the tenacious high school band off key.
But the song didn’t mean anything, just a call
to the field, something to get through before
the pummeling of youth. And what of the stanzas
we never sing, the third that mentions “no refuge
could save the hireling and the slave”? Perhaps,
the truth is, every song of this country
has an unsung third stanza, something brutal
snaking underneath us as we blindly sing
the high notes with a beer sloshing in the stands
hoping our team wins. Don’t get me wrong, I do
like the flag, how it undulates in the wind
like water, elemental, and best when it’s humbled,
brought to its knees, clung to by someone who
has lost everything, when it’s not a weapon,
when it flickers, when it folds up so perfectly
you can keep it until it’s needed, until you can
love it again, until the song in your mouth feels
like sustenance, a song where the notes are sung
by even the ageless woods, the short-grass plains,
the Red River Gorge, the fistful of land left
unpoisoned, that song that’s our birthright,
that’s sung in silence when it’s too hard to go on,
that sounds like someone’s rough fingers weaving
into another’s, that sounds like a match being lit
in an endless cave, the song that says my bones
are your bones, and your bones are my bones,

There is a river under this poem.
It flows blue and icy
And carries these lines down the page.
Somewhere beneath its surface
Lying chained to the silt
Harry holds his breath
And slowly files
His fingernails into moons.
He wonders who still waits at the dock
If the breasts of those young girls
Have developed since he sank.
He thinks of his parents
Of listening to the tumblers
Of his mother's womb
Of escaping upward out of puberty
Out of the pupils in his father's eyes
And those hot Wisconsin fields.
He dreams of escaping
From this poem
Of cracking the combinations
To his own body
And those warm young safes
Of every girl on the dock.
Jiggling his chains
Harry scares a carp that circles
And nibbles at his feet.
He feels the blue rush of the current
Sweeping across his body
Stripping his chains of their rust
Until each link softens
And glows like a tiny eel.
And Harry decides to ascend.
He slips with the water
Through his chains
And climbing over and over
His own air bubbles
He waves to the fish
To his chains glittering
And squirming in the silt.
He pauses to pick a bouquet
Of seaweed for the young girls
on the dock. Rising
He bursts the surface of this poem.
He listens for shouts.
He hears only the night
And a buoy sloshing in the blue.

There is a hole.
In the hole is everything

to each other.
 
The hole goes down and down.
It has many rooms
like graves and like graves

Roots hang from the dirt

It's not clear
where the hole stops
 
beginning and where

It's warm and dark down there.
The passages multiply.
 
There are ballrooms.

It is easy to love a pig in a nightgown.
See how he sleeps, white flannel
straining his neck at the neckhole.
His body swells and then deflates.

over his hulk, original clothing, the milk

I  Self-Portrait
A house
with three stories.
In the basement, monsters.
The upper floors were empty.
No furniture, nothing.
I had a magic pebble
that I needed to hide.
But where?
Woke in a room
with the bed breathing.
Each day the same
scandal—this body.
These teeth and hands.
 
 
 
 
 
2  The Miniature Bed
A miniature bed, and in it two tiny people
not sleeping, not able to sleep because
a small lie has flowered between them,
fragile as a new, white crocus.
The miniature bed holds them like a miniature boat
making its slow, true course to morning.
These tiny people, thoughts thrumming like mice,
are quiet as the lie blooms over them
in the night, fanning its moth petals,
becoming to them like a moon hovering
over their bed, a moon they might almost touch
with their miniature hands, if they weren't certain
that one wrong gesture might break
the spindles of their small world, if their hearts
were not drops of trembling quicksilver,
if they were brave, if they could see
that small is no smaller than big, that thimbles
are deep as oceans for any god, they might even
touch each other then, opening the dark,
like a match, the sun's flaring.     
3  Harvest
 
The fields are a book of uses.
Near the house
a combine takes the corn down
in long rows.
Dust rises up and replaces itself.
A quick net of starlings
drops to the furrows
and sunshine pours like polished grain
onto the feeding earth,
this country.
 
In the kitchen, milk streams
from the gallon
thin and fresh as luck.
We flourish.
All around us, things flourish.
Cows strain the fence with their abundance.
The herd makes a sound like swelling.
 
Out in the cut field
birds clean the fallen cobs
into sets of teeth.     
4  Sonnet for Lost Teeth
 
The combines were tearing off the field’s clothes.
It was August, haying season. My tooth
was loose, a snag in the clam of my mouth.
I worked it like a pearl. I'd been out of school
for sixty days. In the sweat of the barn
I watched him shoot the calf in the head.
He wiped the hide gently, like cleaning his glasses.
Overnight, I grew a beard so I wouldn't
have to get married. I let my feet go black
from burned grasses. It never gets easier
he said, kicking straw over the blood patch.
She went down so quiet it was almost
sad. Later, when my tooth fell out, I buried it
under my pillow and it grew into money.     
5  Talisman
 
Waiting for the school bus you find
the femur of a baby animal
on the ground. You carry
that femur in your pocket
the entire morning and touch it
secretly through the cloth.
When the teacher asks
a question you don't raise
your hand but quietly
wrap your fingers around
the thin shape, that bone
without a mother.     
6  On Waking
 
Half of everything is invisible.
A river drifts below the river.
A gesture lost in the body.
Wind moves through the open
windows of the trees.
 
Beyond the day, another day.
 
Dreamed I was drowning
my mother's silk laundry
in the river,
kneeling on the wet rocks.
Back and forth I drowned it
in the gray clouds...     
7  Eros
 
Each year fish run the green vein of the river.
The bones of skunks lie buried in the riverbank
upside down, waiting for rain.
 
From a fragment of a Greek statue
you can tell the posture of the whole god.
A skeleton has the same intelligence.
 
So that when a girl discovers it,
loosened by summer rain, surfaced
like a white instrument in the grass,
she suddenly knows how to take it up
and shake the strange rhythms from it like castanets.     
8  A Childhood
 
The horse had been beaten and flies
crawled excited on the beat marks.
He held still in the sunblazed pasture.
For a few minutes I stood at the wire fence.
He was aware of me, but he did not turn—
except his eye, slightly. He listened
through the many ears of the grasses.
A jay made a hole in the air with its cry.
Everywhere, invisible as heat, the gods
married each other and went to war.
The excitement of it vibrated in the flies.
As if we both were standing still
inside some greater, more violent motion.

It’s all the rage to sport waxed moustaches
and cure your own sausages
in some mildewy basement that formerly
would have hosted convulsively
awkward parties with spin the bottle and seven
minutes in the dark and terrifying closet
(aka heaven) but now boasts soppressata
strung on repurposed vintage drying racks
and fat clay pots of kombucha and curdling hops.
Personally I've never recovered from the sex-shaped
void left in those closets by all the groping
that should have occurred to me but didn't:
right under my nose kids my age were creeping
into adulthood one clammy, trembling palm
on one breast at a time. There was also
the horror of not being chosen in gym.
It is conceivable that learning intricately
how to butcher an entire hog
and render every morsel might give one
a feeling of mastery one lacked in childhood.It is the greatest immaturity to believe sufferingentitles you to something someone wiser
and grayer than I once said.
But in those basements and carpools and
playgrounds as I assassinated one by one
clandestinely my torturers
abandoning their foul normal
bodies to compost the astonishing
tedium of the wending suburban lanes,
I was transubstantiating to supernal
fame and beauty and such eerie genius
that entire books were written about my
books. In fact it takes a long time to realize
your suffering is of very little consequence
to anyone but you. And by that time the future
is already happening and you're pickling okra
and starfruit and foraging for morels in urban forests
and suspending artisan mozzarella in little wet nets
and crafting small-batch, nitrite-free data
and maybe even thinking about having
children, which you swore in a million
billion years you would never do.

a giant squid and some loose change

headfirst on the East River at twenty-six knots

disaster through quick thinking and sure reflexes. Also
a bow and arrow and glossy red apple
I perch in front of my heart. To be honest
 
my lover doesn't really like poetry,
which I guess is why I plan to write
such a bad one, so he can feel right

Tonight when I go see my lover
he’ll hold me as I've never been held

When I came to this mountainside almost fifty years ago it never occurred to me that there would be an end to it.         I went along never thinking about the time when I would have to quit. I imagined—I guess — all this would last forever, if I imagined it at all. Now I'm in my seventies and all I can think about is the time when my life will be here no more.
         For example, I love being in the woods felling and bucking hardwood trees, stacking and covering the blocks, then a year or two later, hauling them to the woodshed where I stack them again, and split them all winter long into the right size for the weather—then bring them into the house.         Now this chore I love so much is seriously painful, and I can see, now, an end to it.

There is so much I don’t know about you.
Last night I skipped a banquet
so I could stay home and do your laundry
and drink wine from my grandmother’s glass.
When I was your age boys traded quarters
for a claw at my carcass on a pleather bench
while I missed the first few seconds of a song
I’d hoped to record on my backseat boombox.
When I was your age I enjoyed a hook.
You think I know nothing of metamorphosis
but when I was your age I invented a key change.
You don’t have to know what I know.

                ","
Everything has gender
in Arabic.
History is male.
Fiction is female.
Dream is male.
Wish is female.
Feminine words are followed
by a circle with two dots over.
They call it the tied circle,
knotted with wishes
which come true only when forgotten
or replaced by the wishes of others.
In the town of tied wishes,
people feel great anticipation
because a stranger will arrive
today in her feminine sign.
Someone says he saw her
two dots glittering,
refuting another’s vision
of a cat’s eyes hunting in darkness.So scary, he says, how the moon
hides in her red circle",Dunya Mikhail,"Living,Life Choices,Social Commentaries,Gender & Sexuality,Mythology & Folklore,Fairy-tales & Legends"

I wanted to write an epic about suffering,
but when I found a tendril
of her hair among the ruins
of her mud house,
I found my epic there.2
I didn’t sleep last night.
As if the night
were hiding in the morning coffee.3
Her life is a game of snakes and ladders
sent relentlessly back to square one,
but whose life isn’t? She takes a breath
and throws the dice again.4
The city glitters below
the airplane window, not because
of the bones and skulls scattered
under the sun, but the view
through the frosted breather hole.5
She died, and time changed
for those she loved most,
but her watch kept ticking.6
A god carried the burdens
until the weight persuaded him
to transfer them to man — 
the new suffering god.7
The map of Iraq looks like a mitten,
and so does the map of Michigan — 
a match I made by chance.8
If you can’t save people,
at least don’t hate them.9
Her bubbling annoys me — 
can’t understand a word she says.
So what if I toss her from the aquarium?
So what if I spill her new world
with this nasty immigrant fish!10
The city’s innumerable lights
turning on and off remind us
we are born to arrive,
as we are born to leave.11
The handkerchiefs are theirs,
but the tears are ours.12
Women running barefoot.
Behind them, stars falling from the sky.13
So strange,
in my dream of us,
you were also a dream.14
He said to me: You are in my eyes.
Now when he sleeps,
his eyelids cover me.15
Gilgamesh stopped wishing
for immortality,
for only in death could he be certain
of seeing his friend Enkidu again.16
Some say love means
putting all your eggs
in one basket.
If they all break,
can the basket remain intact?17
The homeless are not afraid
to miss something.
What passes through their eyes
is how the clouds pass over the rushing cars,
the way pigeons miss some of the seeds
on the road and move away.
Yet only they know
what it means to have a home
and to return to it.18
The wind and rain
don’t discriminate
in buffeting us.
We are equal
in the eyes of the storm.19
When I was broken into fragments,
you puzzled me
back together
piece by piece.
I no longer fear
being broken
in any moment.20
Freezing in the mountains
without blankets or food,
and all they heard wasno news is good news.21
Their stories didn’t kill me
but I would die if I didn’t
tell them to you.22
Before killing them
they collected their personal effects.
Their cell phones are all ringing
in the box.23
We are not upset when
the grass dies. We know
it will come back
in a season or two.
The dead don’t come back
but they appear every time
in the greenness of the grass.24
If yearning encircles us,
what does it portend?
That a circle has no beginning
and no end?

Ten below, high of zero, 4:11 pm

No woman wants to be low-hanging fruit,
my glamorous girlfriend says, but I’m indiscriminate
and love all fruit, I’m tempted to list each kind
right here, in and out of season,
because even just saying the names gives me pleasure,
as does saying your name.
I’m not alone with my passion — my whole family,
we’re a little off in this regard,
we can spend hours talking about cantaloupe
or arguing over how many flats to buy
when it’s Peach-O-Rama at the Metropolitan.
Once I even drove half a day to get to Pence Orchards
where I met and took photos of Bert Pence,
who sold me three boxes of peaches at wholesale prices.
He was so good to me, as was the late-summer freestone
I picked as I walked back through the orchard
in the August heat to the entrance gates,
which were nothing like the Gates of Hell.
On the contrary, I was in heaven there in Yakima.
I can still smell that single peach, which was profusely
low-hanging, it was the definition of low-hanging,
it fell into my hands, as you did — 
or perhaps as I did into yours — 
but that was months ago.
When I walked past the stands yesterday,
on what should have been the first day of spring,
all produce had been covered with heavy blankets
to keep it warm, to mitigate harm.
Today the temperature dropped so low
someone thought to remove the fruit entirely and stash it away.
With this strange weather we’re having, will I see you again?
I can’t help myself.

                ","
Wheal Emma and Brookwood are abandoned copper mines whose remains are located near Buckfastleigh, within the Dartmoor National Park, an area with a long history of widespread industrial activity. From this one locality, in the second half of the nineteenth century, more than thirty thousand tons of copper ore were raised, processed, and shipped for smelting. In 1859, in order to stabilize and increase the power supply, Wheal Emma Leat (a fifteen-mile-long channel) was cut across moorland and around woodland valleys to transport water from the River Swincombe and to feed the mines by supplementing the Mardle, a tributary of the Dart. Some of this now empty moorland waterway can be walked today on Dartmoor. I am grateful to Kevin and Donna Cox, owners of the Brook Manor estate, for showing my collaborator, Ignacio Acosta, and me over the remains of mine workings on their land.

Widening the plug doorway
on the bob wall left no
surface evidence. The Mardle
has a floodplain fair and wide.
Material would have been
trammed directly, although
blacked ochreous water flows
freely from the collapsed
portal. Humphrey kept Kevin
back when we went into
the near horizontal dark adit
stooped at the panic shaft.
In Brook Wood at the combe
head is a small killas quarry
predating all three setts.
Rent was paid to the Brook Wood
adventurers. Three areas of
dumping partially covered
this crumbled masonry within
woodland of varying density
just south of the tarmac road.
Yet a leat is depicted on the
1886 OS map channeled entirely
in a raised wooden aqueduct.

Then buildings fall into decay
where ivy and tree growth
have taken hold. The silted channel
follows the contour round hills
and combes using the best-fit
method to Wheal Emma sett.
Whereas conifer scrub and dense
patches of rhododendron
are seen quite late in the sequence.
All 99 stations were used and
having passed over the wheel
water may have been diverted.
The long wheelhouse sides are not
straight but slightly kinked to provide
for a dished 60-ft wheel
over an arched tailrace exit
at floor level. In this same evening
were those people engaged to feast
on roast beef and strong ale nearby.
Within the valley of the holy brook
the mines are situated near
Buckfastleigh, crushed ores are hauled
for the South Wales copper smelters,
Alfred Jenkin their agent in Cornwall.
Over and over had they been
in the heaven of expectation
finding the ore ground pitched eastward;
those who gambled their lives in swift
currents and dark treacherous pools.
Granting two properties as
one sett at a royalty of 1/24
together with fine machinery,
wheels, a beam engine, and water
privileges. One hundred and twenty-
five workers being then separated
only by a small transverse valley.
The flat rods moved off so quietly
that those not looking were unconscious
of their being in motion. Steam was
employed only at limited scale.
Emma, 116 fathoms below adit,
pumping backed-up water for life itself:
men cutting lode in fume- and dust-ridden air
or crushing with hand tools, spalling, cobbing,
came our tramroad to harbor direct
in Totnes and thence by sea to Neath — 
no more windlass or horse-whim turning.
What you see here is the dressing floor.
Their Phoenician purple dye — 
their copper with fifteen percent
Cornish tin. Remember when
a solid solution of
metal elements was defined
by ecstatic bonding.
Water poured over its surface
producing hydrogen gas.
The new material is
stable and ready for use
but scaled-up production
could fuel cannibal drones.

Green Pool, 2017, by Ignacio Acosta.
                            

We love the color and
the stillness. Nothing would
live in this water now
at the base of a spoil heap
two stories high. Worm casts
and broadly scattered pits
are laminated onto a
non-conductive substrate.
This is the green pool:
a water soak away
made from glass epoxy.
They are brown and green
like uneven flat loaves
and the museum label
reads tortas de cobre.
Moss grows on anything
like black flame retardant
mechanically supports and
electrically connects — 
the fenced-off shaft
protecting the river
from what leaches out
between sea-borne traders.
At these horizons the levels were
extended over 330 fathoms.
Small groups of self-employed
miners and their families
continued to migrate. Here was
alluvial gold mixed with
sand and gravel, producing
more than 14 heads of stamps were
capable of crushing. Composed
of quartz, peach, and gossan with black
and yellow copper letting down
a stream of mineralized water.
For in much of this section
the leat had been cut from
solid rock. A stone-lined sluice
is just visible. 4,000 shares
on the cost book system,
streamworks in eluvial ground,
5 shillings each deposit. Nothing
but a washing strake such as
we use, commodified and priced
both minerals since the Bronze Age
in West Devon, in Cornwall
beneath a layer of black sand.
An adit is also brought home
to the spot from below: narrow
tailings in steep profile cast
every shovel full as it rises
into a tye. £40,000 worth
of copper ore from above
the 50-fathom level.
Water breaks up the soil, exposing
mere threads of land, linear strips
cut into channels called races
dug across the ground to be worked,
removing the overburden.

A window that can’t be opened is just a see-through wall. Sometimes we’re on the inside like a plane. Most of the time, we’re on the outside like doggie day care. I don’t know if the tomatoes are the new form of his language or if they’re simply for eating. I can’t ask him  because on the other side, there are no words.

Sidewalks glint in sun and trees newly opened oh shit I woke up
             with a tension headache!
Pear blossoms
They smell like semen
For instance I look forward to seeing you all day
No place to put our feet up or
             say anything
Blah blah blahblahblah
Quick let’s do it before the kids wake up!
For a long time I would cut the grass in the morning before
             it got too hot
For instance the basil burned ditto the oatmeal
Growing up I never considered a different kind of  life because we
             had television
It doesn’t seem that long ago
A swimming pool in the living room
White reverb
I used to take off fast but now I take off slow
  •
More a migraine than anything else
Something dull in the bushes is that a rabbit?
A dead squirrel whirligigs
             the light
That light was cling-free
For instance a Coke is nice and something to look forward to and
             you can do it by yourself
I think the day knows exactly what it’s doing
Opening a stuck window or collecting a small fee
But also you see something out the window I don’t see
Moss grows you can count on it
Morning dew scratched at the door then cantered away into what
             we’re not sure of
I filtered everything through rain and got what exactly
             more rain?
The good news is ferns
The good news is graffiti
Those peonies probly weren’t even peonies probly they’re dahlias
  •
But also the kids pick flowers if you let them
Some petals are soapy and blow down the street a quick and linty
             pink and white dream
As for TV there’s always perennials
As for day care there’s always the grass
A pile of nachos in the microwave
Just upstream from a car battery and a glass of SunnyD
Benadryl in the grass and grass insects tuning up the tardy afternoon a
             twitchy kickstart
Her sneeze in the puffed-out dandelions his little cough someplace
             else altogether
It’s time for lunch
It’s time for the sun
Just because you carry something from one day to the next it doesn’t
             make all days the same
Everybody out of  the pool!
The regular skimmers are brightly colored and constant
The regular skimmers are chlorined and cousined
  •
Not only recycling but holding hands in a holding pattern the day
             spends outside
Tied up with kitchen twine and stacked neatly by the curb
A cardboard floats by another
             cardboard
The next thing you know the rain has stopped
And starts again before you know it with a drop and a drop and yet
             another drop
A cup of coffee on the counter
The dogs in the backyard in a lather
Just upstream from a VHS player and a bucket of KFC
Stars look down and count the tops
             of our heads
A cell phone tower via a pine tree
The newly emptied mall parking lot via a lake
I got here late
Wildstyle via FatCap along the chain link was red and yellow spray
             roses
The top of my daughter’s head ditto the top
             of my son’s

The afternoon leans toward television and birds
A dream can stay on all morning and does so sticking around for
             drop-off and pickup
Just in time for a quick once-over
The pansies took ditto the ground cover
More an annual than anything else
The top of my daughter’s head is astro fluff in the
             atmosphere
Blue jays on shuffle in the regular trees
For instance bees make their home in the sandbox
Margarine via butter
The sound of the interstate via the sound of the sea
The top of my son’s head is corn silk shot through a cassette deck
             playing early Black Flag
Alone in the kitchen
Mom presses rewind on the microwave
Dogs melt into the linoleum
  •
Not only that but you don’t have to feel bad anymore
Blue jay by blue jay
The birds are real and wait just outside where
             we left them
Just upstream from the new mixed-use building concern and a two-
             liter of  Diet Squirt
Wings in the wallpaper
Wings and glue
I wasn’t going to do it again but maybe you could describe
             the light?
It’s not easy but it’s a little
             easier
Probly those earwigs weren’t even earwigs probly they were rollypollys
Our loved ones are everywhere
Leaves buffeted by the HVAC system
Their names whispered through an intercom in the evergreens
The blue jay’s nesting material was modern and shining recyclables
             reflected on the surface of  the lawn
A twist of  tinfoil in the shape of a swan
  •
A cloud of dryer lint soundproofs the scrape
Open wires braided in a regular fishtail braid or a 6-pack yoke in a
             classic milkmaid
Cotton wool jute and burlap
Feathers from other birds mixed with regular paper
             and fiberglass
Just upstream from a bottle of  Sumatriptan and a case of  bottled
             water
More a grocery list than anything else
A single zigzag
Tinsel blings the classic cup
Leaves repurposed as sanitizer and a kind of traditional blockwood
             painted or flock wallpaper
Banana leaves and artichokes on fast-forward
Cellulose is waterproof
Human hair or horsehair in a perfect carousel
Not only plastic strips but cellophane draped over the vegetation
A cell phone calls from a cornrow
  •
A bird calls from a saucer or plate
A wire hanger hangs in this regular afternoon a kind of dressing
             chair without a seating assignment
Dead twigs dead leaves and dry
             grass
Reclaimed corners
Reclaimed grass
That monoprint of a maple leaf on the platform
A phosphorous updo
For instance neighbor kids find a nest and check on it each morning
             balanced on a pile of chairs
The ground looks up and then returns to whatever it was doing
             before
Curbside check-in for squeakers
Curbside check-in for suet
Broom bristles mop string and

An onion bag in a topknot
That twist of  tinfoil in the shape of a Park-n-Ride
  •
For instance a light applause breaks out over the swing set slide and
             seesaw combo
Did I tell you I aced the bathroom?
A roll of toilet paper
Scotch-Brite and a butter knife
Probly that nest wasn’t even a nest probly it was a regular
             four-in-hand
Warm water white vinegar and Arm & Hammer
An upload of sunlight
For instance butterflies have tongues and hang them out in the day
             to pick up what exactly?
The local station we used to get we don’t get anymore
Voice mail via an otter
A block-graph via a bluebell
Their tongues curl in the light of a flatscreen projecting a host plant and
             a finale
Four long two short
Sip-sipping a hotspot
  •
For instance the grass looks up and then goes back to whatever
             it was doing before
A very heavy rain followed by a very light rain
Did I tell you I replaced everything and
             all at once?
Dog shit in the backyard
The day in a V shape planted in parks parkways and yards or
             seasonally planted around the house
An attachment via an acorn
A chat room via a catkin
If  the day is fernlike and pointed at the ends and irregular or keeled
             as the times and styles change
A four-ring box clutch via a pillbox
A glass organza via a clinkerbell
Those blue jays probly weren’t even blue jays probly they were
             finches
You can’t put the day back together again
A decal of a hawk silhouette
Just upstream from a pair of  headphones and a Stouffer’s
  •
If  the day is tapered twigs leaf stems and a white undersurface
             tolerating the usual errands
A small tree in the shade of a tall tree
An ozone inside a loophole
More a Lean Cuisine than anything else
We let the grass go yellow on purpose and drove straight to the store
My daughter pulls the grass up
             with her fingers
My son uses scissors
If  the day is deciduous and thin with waves at the margins and
             common or common enough
Did I tell you I vacuumed the carpets and dusted
             the picture window?
A picture of what?
An airplane headed in the direction of  the Willamette
Meanwhile the river looks up and then goes back to whatever it was
             doing before
A landing strip via some riprap
Our futures in a bindle
  •
If the day is untidy looking and aromatic with end-leaflets narrowing
             where the sun is lopsided and lobed
I’ll wait outside
We can’t leave the kids in the car anymore
Or wind or cows or people
Schist in your shoes pick up where we left off
A photo-offset of a fern into a
             spreadsheet
The blue flame in the new gas stove has fins
If  the day is irregular on both sides and pebbled or modified by
             acrylics and permanent
Black toner cartridge via a starling
A stop bath via a sparrow
The afternoon clears the table for flowers and more
             television
Not only whatever’s on but a pinnate in the past
More a dinette set than anything else
The day ticking over in the fixer bath

Meanwhile a northern flicker bends a piece of plexiglass into a wind
             chime

Meanwhile a black-capped chickadee
One kid asleep upstairs another on the pot
Bird clutter marks the spot
Just upstream from a newly relaxed regulation and the brand new
             Jiffy Lube
A birdbath in a dribble!
A damselfly vacates the day in a blur
A mosquito on a daisy
My daughter looks up and then goes back to whatever it was she was
             doing before
The afternoon divided up into zones
Where her new sounds meanwhile astound the daylight
             on a leaf
An off-brand beetle duct-tapes the water
X’s & O’s

You don’t have to if  you don’t want to
Pink rollers via a ripple
Little white sticks via a balk
Meanwhile a deer tick slides into the very last reserved parking spot
Under arms around the ears back of the knees and
             between the legs
Meanwhile inside a belly button
A pink parking pass flutters between the seat cushions
A speckle-winged quill vacates the day in a blind
More a leftover than anything else
That grass probly wasn’t even grass probly it was a roll of   Diamond Pro
             Fescue or Jade 50
A blue tint ditto a cloud of flies
Meanwhile a regular water strider enamels the edge of a pond
             making room for you and the rest of  the day
A stork inside your mind
Dots and lines

In other places we felt much the same as we do today only
             more so
Meanwhile a mayfly floats by another mayfly
A hard drive via a hedge
A Bluetooth via a squiggle
Oh look someone remembered to take out the compost
Meanwhile mites in a double clasp and peaked felt number wish you
             well and more
White foam flowers on a polished floor
Who will tape their wings back?
Who will fold their corners?
A common green lacewing has an appointment someplace else
             altogether and will keep it
To a thrip or a honeydew?
A grand tour
Just upstream from a stackable washer/dryer unit and the brand new
             FreshDirect
The loop that keeps happening in the leaf litter

Before you know it that light has changed from checker mallow and

Whites and sulphurs
Probly that lacewing wasn’t even a lacewing probly it was a green
             smudge
Hey! Hey kids!
Meanwhile a green comma or a common

Their wings are made of cardboard and Reynolds Wrap
A rubber band here a rubber band there
Meanwhile real sunlight sneaks up the wall somewhere between
             butterfly yellow and butterfly brown
Not a dream really just an ordinary afternoon
What color is that goldenrod?
A focal point via a knob
The new streaming service was all aflutter and temporarily

Not only that but a golden hairstreak
One kid on the couch the other in a bole

Just between the dimmer switch and a short circuit of  local or overlit

Hi-Liter yellow and chisel tipped
A bucket of  honeysuckle
Bring the car around I’ll be right out!
Did I tell you I aced the console with some Orange Glo ditto the late
             afternoon?
They blanket the lawn in summer
A long dash followed by a short dash
Right between a commotion of  track lighting and a dribble of newish
             antibiotics
A newish drop in the bucket
An overflow of stillness and snacks
My son looks up and then goes back to whatever it was he was
             doing before
The day is nonslip and early
A download of nervy and rainbowed fluorescence
A bedhead floats by another bedhead
  •
Just between the newly installed porch floods and a small handful of
             cabbage whites
A vertical frequency to it
A sprinkle of what exactly?
Not only that but our intentions stacked up
             in a swirl
The bunting’s vocals were lip-synced and weird ditto the dishwasher’s
A voice box via a gorge
A yellow Lego on top of a yellow Lego
Right between a semi-transparent aftereffect and a latticed or
             crosshatched bit of fluff
An upgrade via a wrinkle
More a floater than anything else
Probly that bunting wasn’t even a bunting probly it was a Western
             Peewee
We began with sliced apple and later moved on to sunlight
An orangetip on a pincushion
A pip on the carpet

The tops of trees
Or an elliptical wastebasket where my son might pick out a glow
             worm or a lime green flashlight fish
The day has its limits
The yard looks the same now than it did just an hour ago
Same rush of  Oregon grape same hurry of
             salmonberry
The names for things slip away
A rotary via a spiral
A router via a tangle
  •
Or a streamer bobs its way across the living room trailing a yellow
             popper through the top water
My daughter ties off an improved clinch knot
A perfection loop
The day is construction paper
             and laundry
It syrups the corners
Not only that but the remote control scuddled in the wingback
Wide open spaces
Or a glint in the kitchen counter where a local slope wrinkles a bowl
             of cereal on the new Formica
The toaster shimmies
A splake floats by another splake
Did I tell you I folded the clothes in a basic reverse squash or rabbit
             fold ditto the onesies?
The day is sound checked and
             perennial   
Appearing and disappearing in the hydrangeas
A plus sign followed by a minus

Or a speck of something else altogether some mica or something
             made of  OJ bits and squinting
A dreamy dusky wing
Meanwhile the grass is back
Butter and eggs are seamless and windowbox the stand mixer organic
             dish soap and phone
A private suburb here where we put things
A plug-in via a stob
Rods and cones
Or cuckoo bees spun out in a bright wash of parallel and early or late
             climber roses
Just upstream from a buffet-style weekend special and some notable
             losses
Pollen paints the car and cleans out eczema
Wicks out the margins
Wisteria points up the positives of nonverbal
             choral work
Or music you can’t hear
Water music
  •
Or a flowering piggyback petals a residue of  light-to-dark jellies and

A smidgen of  Windex
A gimlet in waves

             toothpaste
At the same time heaps of clouds bounce off
             the driveway
I plated the snacks ditto the expectations
Burnt toast and bitumen
Or outside the voices of other children climb up
Taller ones
Pedal bikes pushed up and down the walk all day transfigure
             the pavements in a wired curlicue
A fiddlehead with arms and legs
Or taller trees in a chase
The day is non-glare and leafed out stuccoed by
             robot beetles
One television is off the other is vertical rays of  light
  •
Or a #2 pencil beam crinkles the cornea in the backyard feathering seed
             starters and stems
The day feels irreversible and will stay inside a Dixie cup
Things stick to the door screen
Windy light broken off and moth dust broken off
Ribs and holes
Not only that but a complicated system of noticing and a dob of
             apple juice
You blow on it and it glows
Or a refurbished working day backlights the hanging geraniums a
             handful of pink fiberglass
A lake effect glancing off the sideboard
A streamer via a stickle
A cooler via a brook
More than that those green and gold flecked inlays look away
A creek bed in the hallway   
A spiral floats by another spiral
  •
And pink and blue transparencies gel the day each morning
And pansies more than you
You don’t have to wonder about the sky anymore you don’t have to
             ask what to wear
Just upstream from a sketchy weather system and the new overpass
High on glue
The raindrops can’t lash the ferns they can’t
             flash flood a pinna
Then the sun comes out again
And trees are stressed out and can’t get going either
It’s dinnertime breakfast is over
Over and over my son’s voice across the lawn a white sparkler then
             a green sparkler then a white
Someone comes running
Probly those geraniums aren’t even geraniums probly they’re trailing
             accents
Local traffic
Left to your own devices you would watch TV clips all day and              
             make more toast and then what brush your teeth?
  •
And vacuuming the carpet makes a nice smell part burnt tips part
             wet dog
It’s difficult to think of something to do
A snip floats by another snip
I guess what you’re doing today is doing chores
I picked up everything in the house and put them all back down just
             to the left of themselves
Pajamas and urine
A throw rug via a jelly roll
And its color time and petal time again & leaves lift the light outside
             the window just enough
Let the flowers back in ditto the dog
You only have a few minutes for anything it’s hardly enough time
      to get started
Hey! Hey trees!
Did I tell you I scoured the linoleum with an X-Acto and cleaned out
             the wayback?
One tree is a pine and one is a maple I know that
One tree is you

And a handheld  Japanese coffee grinder collects dust and would
             after any wedding not just ours
Bags of  groceries wait in a brown line
A skater floats by another skater
Green feedback
Golden raisins
If  you want to hear lake water lapping it up those thousand tongues
             pushing past duckweed you’ll have to imagine it
A basin inside a teacup
And slices of orange radiate in a Ziploc
No one uses sprinklers here except the university we’re just as happy

Just upstream from your first home and anything that’s leftover
Repetitions in crinoline

In the morning the kids come running down the stairs

We were up late and everyone had been drinking, and someone said, Hey, is that God’s
head on the boil?
We didn’t know where to look or what to think, it was obviously some sort of perverse
joke, or not, right?
And the conversation went on for days, sober, drunk, asleep, awake, what did it matter?
Some of us felt the real time was for something, but what?
And the questions kept coming, once they started, my favorite one being two strung
together, What makes art “modern” and what does “urgent” mean now?
Where was the greater good? That was another one bandied about,
followed by Where was the common tent? which gave a feeling of empathy for a minute
and then grief because, well, where was it?
Will you arm, hoard seeds, go hungry? Those terrified me because, after all, who will
repair things when the end is pale or dark?
Where will you hide out
when capital runs out, when water? Which will be greater, the heat or the cold?
Wait, did God’s boiling head just say something? Cry out Go to hell from a giant lobster
pot? Tantalizing us with where to go next?
Are phosphorescent lamps to mark escape paths?
Not that it’s not a great party, but whose place is this? Igniting
quail in banana leaves, sons bandaged, who invited us?
Why are the emerald bleeding and the ivory weeping? (Lower the freaking music.)

I was one year old when my nanny went away
leaving no memory of a face that watched,
arms that held, hands that fed and cleaned me,
left no record of her voice or name. My father
died, leaving wisps of pipe smoke for a memory.
My mother went away to write in London,
left me at her home place, Ballyrankin,
a sheltered farm in the Slaney river valley.
I listened to stories from a paralyzed aunt
sitting among sleepy dogs next to the fire.
Statia cooked every day for the dining room,
churned butter, gave sugared bread to me and
her child Bernie, fed outside men in dirty boots
and greasy caps in her stone-flagged kitchen that
smelt of damp clothes, roasting meat, and cake.
I fished for minnows in Shillelagh stream under ash trees
where filtered sunlight made pools of silver water.
On one side horses grazed and swished
their tails at flies, on the far side cows rubbed
their backs against low beech tree branches.
My mother went away to hospital, left me with
English neighbors, the Smythe Vigours’
hairy legs banged on passage floorboards,
my bedroom filled with evening sun.
They warned against crying. I cried louder.
They took my pearl pink rosary beads given
to me by a monk from a mountain monastery.
He told me Holy Mary answered children’s prayers.
A protestant child, I didn’t know the words, but I knew
she’d hear me if I could catch the sunlight on her beads.

Look.

host, then me

There were no road rails.
I remember no road rails and the death depth off the cliffs
we motored along.
I remember speed in a parched Chevy clunker that could not have sped,
and bench seats, and no buckles, and bare thighs peeling off faux leather
at every hairpin. Every elevated canyon mile was a feat
but a breath of less slickened air too, less cog and fume — 
a winding away from
the wavering, sea-leg steam off blinding sidewalks,
infinite sidewalks and other shoeless kids
kicking rusted palm leaves outside infinite apartment complexes. Away from
our corner
of the valley of concrete corners, of
no evidence of valley besides boulders stacked in the distance of every vista.
The driver was a stranger, was my mother after my whole life had passed
with stranger after stranger,
was my mother after seven years, and me at seven years
with her driving that snuff-colored Nova from her blinding valley not a valley — 
through Laurel, Topanga, Malibu
canyons all the way to some fantastic, to her beloved
blue — eucalyptus
choking local growth the whole trek. And the cooling air as we  efforted west,
and the jolt of a castle, The Castle,
in a distant crook of a range that hid the slate of the ocean,
made me want to stop moving
but not stop here. I remember hoping
to find hermit crabs the size of the mole on my right side chin.
And if I tethered them to a stick they’d line up by mass and trade shells, find homes
that fit. And there’d be one left without, one torn out. A book said
a scientist leaned into wet sand, watched a torn crab die
in the beak of a gull. I can’t remember if I saw that death or read it.  I remember
watching a wrong castle tucked into a wrong mountain notch on the chin of the sky,
like the hermit mole on my chin
if my face were the sky. “It’s a beauty mark,”
my mother had said, “Don’t pick at it.” I eyed that smoking stranger at the wheel
and dug my nail in
as the Pacific swelled into view that first time.

Dear A. — Nailing crockery to the walls
was not something I ever understood,
but Simonetta’s maiolica falls,
like this sideboard, painted wood,
under the enchantment of a freehand look — 
a curling script, a loose grape tendril,
the forms that hecatomb smoke took
purling to a Roman god’s nostril    ...    
Because geranium is crinkled
in the spillage from the wishing well,
now outdated and backfilled,
this whole place evinces the nature
of a souvenir plate. Another tell:
the mosquito flourish in its signature.ii
The rustic bicycle, like a pen
that spent its ink, wrote an invisible sentence
to the ramparts and back, now and again
rolling through the arches of an aqueduct
dowsing with its sixth sense
across the hillsides. Locals tucked
plastic water bottles under spouts
chiseled into lions’ pouts
stationed at intervals, like shrines.
Their cars idled while they stooped,
and on Sundays even formed lines.
They trust this water more, Lorenzo whooped,
than what comes out of their taps?
The sources snake beneath the maps.iii
The little terrier Amore, they warned me,
had eaten the seat belts; so there I was,
my friend, fearing whiplash in the back seat

who dream they’ve merely grown discreet.
And the dissertation she once wrote
on courtesan-poetesses, fancying herself
of that ilk (“Like me!” — a phrase she’d strew
among her compliments) gathers dust on a shelf.

He said he buried
his right eye in South Georgia — 
on a dare, he said,
when he was little, beneath
one green ash of two
that mark the end of a road

something, maybe Dog

he couldn’t love me, not

his tongue as a tip
slid under a mug
at a small North Florida diner,
would collect it too
along the way, seeing
as he’d asked the server
to save it, and she had kindly
agreed. Three of his ribs
were further gone — one in Wisconsin,
where he’d planted it like a tree
though he believed even then
nothing would bloom on it.
Another he pawned in Manitoba
for a silver bracelet,
which he wore only
when he was very sad,
and his last rib
he’d been keeping
in a safe deposit box
in a credit union

stopping often at vantages
to take in expanses of pines
covered in moss

1
No one knows where I’m going,
not even me. Although that owl
I heard outside last night might
lead me to the terrain and call out
the custodians so they can
surround and welcome me, or
do whatever they want to do. I won’t
speak, won’t say my name even if
they try to coerce me, or play
unearthly music, such as sailors
hear far out on the Atlantic, in fog
so thick they venture to climb it
to reach clear sky. Some do and speak
of large blue birds that glide there
silently as ghosts, but those men
return too damaged to speak much
or stay above ground very long.
The owl could tell more, if he wanted,
but he won’t. And not only that,
he’s decided he will never be seen.2
I’m happy to honor that, but I’d like
to know what kind of owl he is.
I mean, is he blue, or is he striped
so he can blend with the forest?
Is he tall and white, from the Arctic,
or a pygmy, from further south?
Is he long-eared or spectacled? I want
to hear again the noise he made,
was it a screech, or a staccato huhuhu
followed by a deep-drawn whoo,
or did it sound like wood being sawn?
I am ashamed I paid it no attention.
I did not know then he was a messenger,
albeit a taciturn one. How does he know
me, and why is he so interested? Once
a parrot took stock of me, learnt to speak
my name in exactly the tones I said it in,
mimicked it endlessly and so loudly
that I ran from my laughing friend’s house
with my shrill-voiced name hurling after me.3
Where does the owl go during the day?
How can he know I’ll still be here
when he surfaces? I do take trains — 
I go north sometimes, pulled by my past.
I fly to places. Will he know all this
and follow me everywhere? When can I
expect his sounds to morph into spoken
words that I understand and act on,
if I agree with him? But if I decide
to stay put, never leave the bedroom,
will he get fed up standing there
and row away through the night air,
hooting a farewell? I don’t think so,
no, this fellow is here for the duration
of my stay on this enormous ball
and could tell right now how long that
will be, and what messy adventures
are still ahead of me, but his trick is
to keep as schtum on such stuff as
the wooden owl on my bedside table.4
I’ve heard stories about owls, how they
appear from nowhere at the edge of things
to sit watching, usually staying silent,
but sometimes uttering a few words in
their night language we don’t understand.
That’s my fellow, although I don’t know him.
Should I leave the house and hold my
right arm out for him to land on and turn
his big eyes on me? As if he’d be so compliant.
Or should I try to forget him, pretend
he’s not there in the dark, like a tree
I hadn’t noticed growing? Oh, at least
I should stop mentioning him here, but what
else can I write about? Not the journey
I’m taking that I know nothing of, not yet,
and when I do I mightn’t feel like writing.
I think the solution might be to buy
a T-shirt with an owl printed on it,
a blue owl, on a yellow shirt, and write
about that small fellow to begin with.5
What I want to learn is this: do owls
ever venture inside, to stand on a corner-
table, cock their heads to one side,
and take in completely what’s going on?
There are mice here that may be welcome,
but I know my owl would be suspicious.
He’d assume I want him inside to see
what he looks like, to make friends with him,
so he’ll be kind to me. I could promise
to wear a blindfold and say nothing,
act like I don’t know he’s there, but I will
know and that’s enough. I think I hear
his thoughts and I’m sure he hears mine.
I feel his big eyes on me all the time.
Maybe I should start carrying the wooden
owl around with me, and practice owl noises.
When is he going to tell me what he has to?
I’m not asking for a map, but I’d like to know
where I’m headed, if not where I’ll end up.
And I’d like to know it as soon as I can.6
When I say I hear his thoughts, I hear some,
not the important ones. And here’s one
of mine — if he ventured inside this house
he’d see something that might intrigue him,
a hand-knitted toilet roll cover, in rings of
purple, red, and white. Like an unknown planet
hanging in the sky. I’d let him have it, take it
back to his nest, or his hollow tree trunk, or his
half-sunken boat. I know he’ll assume this
is another example of special pleading,
and I accept that. Would I do better to ignore
him, let him stay out there, like a pinecone
that remains unobserved? I saw my doctor
yesterday, he spoke of the deterioration,
and I felt the owl was hiding in a cupboard,
agreeing with every word. After that I went
to my sister’s grave and the owl flew back
to wherever he’s been ordered to lurk
while observing me. Maybe I should feel
privileged to have his full-time attention.7
This morning I captured a beetle climbing
the parsley. I put him in an empty matchbox,
wondering what the owl thought of this.
Would it impact what might be unfolding?
I doubted this. I slipped on some spidery jazz
that I knew would annoy the owl. He needed
to be in control. I ground coffee beans
and made espresso. The aroma wafted through
the house. I freed the beetle to explore
the table, and when it wandered off the edge
I let it. I’m sure it survived, but I’m not bothered,
just as I know the owl doesn’t care about me.
We are thrown together, all of us, by winds
that come here from far-off worlds. I sipped
my coffee, humming the tune spun through
the jazz, and I felt quite well for the first time
in weeks, even months. Was the owl watching — 
had he been in contact with the beetle?
And what was their collective verdict on me?
Did it add up to more negative evidence?8
OK, I’m blanking him. I watched a crow today,
really admired how he operated, looking
after the young ones, his partner, none of
this spying on others. I’ve decided I don’t like
owls, their self-absorption, or their nosiness
about people. I know which I’d rather be.
And I don’t have to deal with a crow stalking me.
The owl would laugh about these thoughts.
He’s been given the task of waiting to release,
when he can, exactly what I need to know
or what he can reveal. I admit he’s not easy
but, shit, he’s the dumb card I’ve been dealt
and I have to pretend I like him. Can I ask him
about the Oxford and Cambridge rowers,
or about the hairdressers the Louisianians use,
or the tiger cubs that Texans keep as pets?
The owl would make minced meat of them all.
I wish he would hoot another noise to me.
I might even acknowledge his importance,
given my situation, but I won’t reveal anything.9
I felt the presence of the owl last night.
He was in the room with me. Not literally — 
he appeared in a dream, where a blue van
struggled up an icy road before sliding back
in a horrible, wriggling way, to what felt
like an end. I’m not sure how it seemed so.
And I can’t say where the owl was in this
little film, except he was definitely there.
This morning I came down the stairs,
expecting some sign from him. I found
a few brown feathers on a white plate
on the kitchen table. OK, then, he must be
a brown owl, but why donate some feathers,
and what did these denote? I made coffee,
then put on a CD of Anouar Brahem’s oud
that seemed to suit the moment. And I
decided it was the time to poach two eggs
to serve on top of two slices of rye bread
while I primed the espresso machine again
and asked myself what the owl was saying.10
Those feathers were gone from the plate
when I went back for them this evening,
so I wondered if maybe I’d imagined them,
or if they’d fluttered up from the eggs
before I’d poached them. That doubt was
caused by the owl, I was sure — I’d made him
careless, and he was recovering his poise,
his control. And I was back in the place
where I knew nothing, where he liked me to be.
I opened the door and stood there, listening,
but no owl sound came. Then a bat just barely
avoided my head, and glided toward the moon.
I stood watching this leathery fellow, then
closed the door, and opened some wine.
How much did the owl control? Would I
be attacked by a rat tonight while I slept,
not savagely, but enough to terrify me?
Or would cockroaches swarm on my duvet,
clicking enough to wake me? The idea being
that these would render me so punch-drunk
I’d welcome whatever the owl had to say.11
I spent the morning drawing owl after owl
on bits of paper, and after I’d got somewhere
near a proper depiction, I found a black marker
and reproduced it on an A2 drawing page
which I Pritt Sticked onto the gable wall, then
I dug out my old black bow and four arrows
and unleashed these into the body of the owl.
I knew I was being provocative, maybe even
launching an act of war, but I could take no
more, and couldn’t see what I had to lose.
The owl clearly was unmoved by this, so I
repeated the desecration four times over
till the drawn owl looked machine-gunned,
whereupon I flung the bow down on the grass
and went in to pour a large glass of  Talisker
for the first time in months, if not years.
It still tasted good. I slipped on Kind of Blue,
which always chilled me, and lay on the sofa
with my shoes kicked off, and the curtains
wide open. I thought, let the owl do his worst.12
When the dark came, I lurked in the kitchen,
bow in hand, arrows in the quiver that hung
from my left shoulder, like the Robin Hood
I wanted to play in the school pantomime — 
I got Little John instead! I kept looking out at
the dark garden, wondering if I should be there,
waiting to fire arrows at any sound or movement.
Why did I want to kill the owl? He hadn’t given
me the news I dreaded, but he’d stayed silent.
That was more than I could bear. I poured a
glass of Malbec and put on a CD of Baltic jazz.
Did he think I could wait forever, as if I were
a rock? I sliced some cheddar and a heel of bread,
opened the back door and went out. The moon
turned its big eye onto me, and I saw it wobble.
The stars hummed along. Where am I going?
I shouted at all of them. There was no response.
Then far off, I heard a faint huhuhu followed by
a whoo. You cowardly bastard! I roared, and
sprayed the arrows all over the blackened world.
