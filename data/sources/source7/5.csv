                    Naming the Heartbeats
                ","
   I've become the person who says Darling, who says Sugarpie,     Honeybunch, Snugglebear—and that’s just for my children.     What I call my husband is unprintable. You’re welcome. I am     his sweetheart, and finally, finally—I answer to his call and his     alone. Animals are named for people, places, or perhaps a little     Latin. Plants invite names for colors or plant-parts. When you     get a group of heartbeats together you get names that call out     into the evening’s first radiance of planets: a quiver of cobras,     a maelstrom of salamanders, an audience of squid, or an ostentation     of peacocks. But what is it called when creatures on this earth curl     and sleep, when shadows of moons we don’t yet know brush across     our faces? And what is the name for the movement we make when     we wake, swiping hand or claw or wing across our face, like trying     to remember a path or a river we’ve only visited in our dreams.

      and armpits. Your teacher means well,     even if he butchers your name like
      he has a bloody sausage casing stuck     between his teeth, handprints
      on his white, sloppy apron. And when     everyone turns around to check out
      your face, no need to fush red and warm.     Just picture all the eyes as if your classroom
      is one big scallop with its dozens of icy blues     and you will remember that winter your family      
took you to the China Sea and you sank     your face in it to gaze at baby clams and sea stars      
the size of your outstretched hand. And when     all those necks start to crane, try not to forget      
someone once lathered their bodies, once patted them     dry with a fluffy towel after a bath, set out their clothes      
for the first day of school. Think of their pencil cases     from third grade, full of sharp pencils, a pink pearl eraser.

Like nights we knelt on the dirt floor
of a dugout, leaned our heads back,
eyes twitching gone, and popped nitrous
canisters into the communion shapes
of our mouths, slipped inside where
everything seemed to be falling snow,
ice, the time split between chasing flies
through a darkened park and sprawling
in sycamore bark—how clean that abyss
we drifted in, like dew, more like pollen,
on our skins; and, beneath, a want
for touch, a kiss, a return. Like nothing
back then, to break an arm latching on
to the bumper of an Impala, or settling back 
as the car took us as far as the salted bridge,
before letting the ride go with a mitten
caught behind the chrome waving
from the other side of the river. Like this, 
you said, sliding a needle, watching
dope plunge, the body's rush and tow
until you felt something like an angel
hovering above, but it was only pigeon
feathers deviling the air. Those friends
are gone: some dead, dying, locked up
or jailed in themselves; and when I see
some kids running in the heat of a taillight
swirling behind them, I remember we
wanted only to quiet our bodies, their 
unnatural hum, a vague pull inward,
some thin furrows gliding over the snow.

All of us were boys only some were taller or already in high school, and almost
      nothing else
mattered but to learn some new trick,
to pull off something we saw in a skate video, wind cutting 
around our bodies when we flew
off the lip of a ramp, grabbed the board and twisted
into a 180, kicking 
a leg out and landing it, the only way to run
through the neighborhood
was to run through it
together, flipping off cops and skinheads, I almost
don't even remember girls but a vague sense of the taste of bubble gum
and how they smelled so different
from us, sitting in some kid's basement drinking
his parents' vodka, we grew out our bangs, moved in a pack,
jumped in when some one of us 
got jumped,
so when a man we had never seen before
came up and started beating on Simon, one of us dropped his skateboard, walked
over to the man
like someone walking into a bank
and stabbed him.
The man, startled, sat down, right there on the asphalt,
right in the middle of his new consciousness,
kind of looking around.

My mother and I are on the front porch lighting each other's cigarettes
as if we were on a ten-minute break from our jobs
at being a mother and son, just ten minutes
to steal a moment of freedom before clocking back in, before
putting the aprons back on, the paper hats,
washing our hands twice and then standing

hoping for tips, hoping the customers

front yard before us and the dogs 
in the backyard shitting on everything.
We are hunched over, two extras on the set of The Night of the Hunter.
I am pulling a second cigarette out of the pack, a swimmer

inside and sit in the yellow kitchen and drink
the rest of the coffee 
and what is coming to kill us will pour milk

Supine, its belly swells with salt and figs with meat and treaties, it corks open a profound song— itself it sings into books heavy with truths on the chair dressed with leather and raw hides kissed by ox blood smeared with beef dung lined with raw silk woven from worms plucked from boughs basted across its pious beaming eyes its spidery ghosted lids, and its byzantine glance unmoors from its Chinese porcelain and crosses the ebony table polished with lac secreted from the cloaca of the kerria lacca set with glazed cakes eaten by pinked mouths wearing crimson robes, to its guests polished and glossed and stained by the ooze drawn to color the uncolored raw linen, the wood, the human.

There once lived a great king whose twin wives could bear him no children. A wandering sage saw the king’s grief and offered him a magical mango. She who ate the mango would be with child. As he had two wives, the king cut the mango into two perfect halves and offered one half to each wife. After nine months, each wife gave birth to one lifeless half. Horrified, the king ordered these clots of flesh to be left in the forest. A wandering demon found the two lifeless halves and cupped one in each palm. When she brought them together, the two halves fused and a whole child was made in front of her eyes—the demon named the child Jarasandha.
Years passed by and this child grew to be an intimidating and invincible warrior. In a fight with Bhim, an equally invincible warrior, Jarasandha was ripped in half by his enemy. But, each time he was ripped apart, his halves found a way to meet up and become whole. Krishna, who witnessed how Jarasandha’s flesh found its own way back to flesh, motioned to his own cousin with his fingers: toss the halves of his body in opposite directions, he
suggested.
So, when Bhim ripped Jarasandha apart once again, he swung his left half to the right side of the arena and his right half to the left. And his body found no way to return to itself.

I stand there holding her hand, my own luggage reluctantly traveling in loops on the belt.

                    M is for Michael Jackson and Malcolm X
                ","
  In the epilogue to The Autobiography of Malcolm X, Alex Haley recounts meeting a pensive Malcolm at the Kennedy airport, watching newly immigrated children “romping and playing” in their sudden home. “By tomorrow night,” Malcolm says to Alex, “they’ll know how to say their first English word—nigger.”
Before cable television arrived in India, America was a white nation. I imagined New England snows dusting California and Miami’s beaches stretched across Appalachia. America was a papier-mâché parody patched together by a cheaply hired prop maker. Geographic accuracy was sacrificed to the interpersonal dramas of Betty and Veronica, and the American banquet was limited to the malted and fried offerings in Pop’s Chock’lit Shoppe, where the Riverdale gang solved the real geopolitical problems of how to get Reggie off Moose’s back with the help of Archie’s fumbling charms. Here, class warfare came with a side of fries. There were rumors of distant family members “settling” in “North Dakota” or “Oklahoma”—names that put themselves together like Lego castles: hard-edged and jutting out with an abrupt L or a particularly pokey K.
Blackness was just a rumor too. Blackness flickered in the background of photographs they sent back from these mysterious locations: here’s an uncle waving at us from a glittering Times Square (Los Angeles); here’s an aunt waving at us mid-way through the soft-focus neon breakfasts with Aunt Jemima’s maple syrup (made from maple leaves); here’s a nephew waving at us next to the poster of a red and white Michael Jordan in a quilted bedroom, his rotund brown body snuggled in tie-dye and tucked into tartan flannel sheets. Blackness was a rumor, that is, until Michael Jackson’s Bad ripped into our consciousness and suddenly, knobby-kneed pre-teens found a way to make stringy curls with coconut oil stolen from their mothers’ kitchens and started moonwalking backwards into my Social Studies classrooms, all snappy crotch and jaunty limbs. We girls rolled our eyes but we kept on watching.
It wasn’t long before Jackson’s unsparing gaze, draped in slick black leather, began replacing the glowing pastel Ganeshes and Saraswatis hanging above study desks. But replacing an elephantine god’s soft paunch with lean, mean celebrity did not save us from our own ignorance of how blackness and brownness were connected through a struggle for economic self-realization and human rights. While kids in Chennai were rehearsing Michael Peters’ signature choreography for “Thriller” and pretending to be zombies—little exemplary half-dead spectacles—Union Carbide was industriously shirking responsibility for the Bhopal Tragedy, which choked thousands of Indians to death, and black mortality was spiking in violent, homicidal protest of the US DEA’s drug buys and cocaine busts.
In other words, Tamilians blinked away Michael Jackson’s blackness. We kept the heat and thunder of his fat synth bass, which found its way into Ilayaraaja’s electric disco in films of the late 1980s like Vetri Vizha and Agni Natchathiram. We kept the ebullient automation of his moves, which became a muscular theme in Prabhu Deva’s blend of baggy breakdance and whimsical terukoothu folk dancing in the 1990s. But we forgot his blackness. In time, the lightning of his presence was replaced by the grey hum of CNN, Cops, Law & Order, and the dull horror of handcuffs on dark wrists. Posters yellowed, cassettes spooled out, and my moonwalking classmates found their scientific calculators and study guides again.
But the rumors of racial difference in George Bush Sr.’s America continued to bloom and wilt in morose cycles in my childhood homes into the 1990s. In damp clusters, it grew like moss under rocks. Rootless, it stretched its stringy arms and held us by the ankles; it grew like mold between bathroom tiles; it spun itself fine and strong, webbing into corners where our brooms couldn’t reach. In time, the mossy rocks lined our after-dinner walks past the hibiscus bushes. In time, a grandmother slipped on the bathroom tiles and stayed in bed, fed conjee by a fatherless girl brought in from the village and the moss grew between her toes and drew her into the earth where they buried the nameless pets and tossed the chicken feathers. In time, the spiders hung so low they fell into pickle jars every time a child fished for a gooseberry or a slice of stony green mango from the brine. And from this brine, in time, we learned to believe that it existed. And as Tamilian families began drifting from the flashy monsoons of India to the June gloom of the California bay or to the sharp wet summers of the Keys, they carried the damp and stench in suitcases and buried it in hushed conversations. They made a poultice of moss and spider web and lodged it in the prayer books, hung it around the children’s necks like a talisman, and they said—as long as she doesn’t marry a black man.

She was my Sunday school teacher
when I was just seven and eight.
He was the newly hired pastor,
 
an albino, alarming sight
with his transparent eyelashes
and mouse-pink skin that looked like it
 
might hurt whenever she caressed
his arm. Since Eva was her name,
to my child’s mind it made great sense
 
that she should fall in love with him.
He was Adán. Before the Fall
and afterward, her invert twin.
 
And she, Eva, was blonde as well,
though more robust, like Liv Ullmann.
I loved her honey hair, her full
 
lips; her green eyes a nameless sin.
(Not that I worried all that much—
the church was Presbyterian.)
 
In Sunday school, her way to teach
us kids to pray was to comment
on all the beauty we could touch
 
or see in our environment.
My hand was always in the air
to volunteer my sentiment.
 
Since other kids considered prayer
a chore, the floor was usually mine.
My list of joys left out her hair
 
but blessed the red hibiscus seen
through the windows while others bowed
their heads. Her heart I schemed to win
 
with purple prose on meringue clouds.
—For who was Adán, anyway,
I thought, but nada spelled backward?
 
While hers, reversed, called out, Ave! Ave! The lyric of a bird
born and airborne on the same day.
 
But it was night when I saw her
outside the church for the last time:
yellow light, mosquitoes, summer.
 
I shaped a barking dog, a fine
but disembodied pair of wings
with my hands. She spoke in hushed tones
 
to my parents. The next day I would find
myself up north, in a strange house,
without my tongue and almost blind,
 
there was so much to see. This caused
Cuba, my past, to be eclipsed
in time, but Eva stayed, a loss.
 Ave, I learned, meant also this:Farewell! I haven’t seen her since.

She taught me the names of flowers: calendula, ranunculus, Iceland
poppy. And the medicinal uses of herbs: Fenugreek opens up a
stuffy head; goldenseal lubricates the cracked mucous membranes.
Over a circa 1820 American dropleaf table, she told me asparagus
was the broom of the kidneys. I hadn't understood at first and
thought she'd used a German word I pictured as brüm and not as the
little stalks standing on their heads, sweeping out the impurities. I
learned to make the perfect roux for soufflé and became her
efficient assistant in the kitchen—dicing and chopping, she once
told me, with unparalleled patience. Then one day she began to
accidentally break my Depression glassware, and I recalled how
she'd giggled when she told me that in two years of marriage she
had single-handedly decimated her husband's glass collection
dating from 1790 to 1810, including a rare wedding goblet. In the
doorway to the back porch she stated simply that my presence
made her feel strangled, it was nothing I was doing or could do. We
saw a therapist for six years, while my collection dwindled then
became memory. With unparalleled patience I jumped through
hoop after burning hoop, the therapist pointed out, but I heard that
as praise for my prowess and continued to balance Bauer plates on
my nose on command; hold growling tigers off with Windsor dining
room chairs; juggle career, job, hope, and nightly tempests with
unparalleled dexterity. I could reassemble anything: shattered pictures
of us crossing the street with canes in the future, my hand under her
elbow. My heart. But what I lacked, I can see now, was the ability
to dissemble. Finally, she brought home a Cuisinart food processor,
and I started hearing the minutes slicing away with ferocious velocity,
time doing its soft-shoe faster and faster like Fred Astaire on
amphetamines. Memories of flowers and herbs were sacrificed to
the angry god of its vortex. Your voice is like acid on my skin, she
said after twelve years, then grabbed her Cuisinart and left me
behind like so much history.

There are no doors between the rooms. The archways bore
through the house like a tunnel through a mountain. The room
one falls into after my parents’ is the largest and serves as two
bedrooms divided by an invisible wall. Half of it is my brother’s
and the other half my sister and I share, but not at first.

          teases me for not eating and says my goat is delicious. I
          stray away to watch the monkeys.
 
          I give one of the monkeys near the fence my banana. As it
          finishes peeling it meticulously, another monkey appears
          behind it and shoves the banana into its own mouth. The
          first monkey turns around, slaps it in the face with the
          empty peel, but that monkey isn’t sorry and starts jumping
          and screeching and showing its yellow teeth.

hat, lurking just outside the door, watching me in a sinister way. The
dead weight of my sister’s habitual leg thrown across my body is no

In the garden, it’s there. Even when you’re inside you feel it,
as though it were you standing naked among the weeds,
 
the tips of the bougainvillea bursting into flame, your nipples
ruffled like the skin of a lake by a breeze.
 
You worship the invisible body like an old-fashioned lover, from afar,
loving the specificity of space between you.
 
Sometimes at night it stretches out on the empty side
of the bed, stares at you with the length of its invisible surface.
 
Every contour of your body not filled by you is molded
by the attentiveness of the invisible body, whose breath surrounds

It’s more than prayer it wants—more than language, with its
     conditions.
The invisible body demands you invent new senses to receive it,
 
new places on your body to marvel at its subtlety,
like the eyes of the deaf percussionist that perceive sound.
 
II.
The invisible body wants you to become a satellite dish,
tuned to what exists only because your body calls to it.
 
Like the woman who had her kitchen remodeled to make room
for the microwave she’d entered a contest for. Then won.
 
III.
When asked whether falling in love was about acquisitiveness,
about the ego, the seventy-five-year-old poet
 
responded that the ego had nothing to do with it;
it was the need for union with the beloved.
 
Rumi asks, Who is it we spend our entire lives loving? 
 
IV.
How, then, do you measure the invisible body,
which resists commitment but is faithful?
 
Is it clear who the beloved is, when no clear
body exists that can be measured against a standard?
 
V.
The invisible body sometimes acquires a body—it’s so convincing,
it takes you a while to figure out it’s really the invisible body.
 
Like someone who has been reading your journal,
it has decoded from your petty, daily complaints the open sesame
 
that slides the stone from the hidden cave’s opening
and cleans you out while you sleep, leaving a sarcastic note.
 
It wants you to know it was doing you a favor, besides,
how else did you think you’d discover the cave’s precise location?
 
When Aphrodite sharpens you, you sacrifice a little of yourself,
willingly, as a knife does, so that you may become better at it.
 
VI.
This is the point at which the invisible body speaks
in italics, the Ouija board of poetry.
 In my mind, says the invisible body, that time capsule shuttlingthrough space, I hold, in all the languages of the world,
 your love, rushed like holographic platters to a table,steaming into the future long after you’ve ceased to shine,
 the silver faces of your beloved bobbing out of the darkness,the black velvet pillow of your life on which you offer them for view.
 
VII.
The invisible body is created out of your longing, your longing
compressing invisible molecules together into an absence you
     recognize.
 
That is the way one blind man sees the world—after the fact,
in photographs he took, once he had passed through it.

Recycled over and over
people born look like parents,
grandparents, sister or brother,
or perhaps a throwback
from an earlier ancestor,
the hawk nose, a hard ridged forehead,
the cleft in the chin or a blue birthmark
on the arm, the stomach,
the dainty fresh bum of a newborn
each unique like a snowflake never
can you guess what’s on their mind
sometimes I can feel what they’re feeling
detect it like hairs on the back of my arms,
together we live, talk, walk the same sidewalks,
to die buried in a foreign cemetery
for others to sit upon ponder their
own light, why am I free, what must I do,
does someone love me like I do,
new skin gives way to wrinkles,
hair fades to gray, bones grow strong
then decay, strength seeps every time
one pees, sleeps, ages, loves,
muscles grow then shrink the body

One face looks out from all his canvases,
One selfsame figure sits or walks or leans:
We found her hidden just behind those screens,
That mirror gave back all her loveliness.
A queen in opal or in ruby dress,
A nameless girl in freshest summer-greens,
A saint, an angel — every canvas means
The same one meaning, neither more or less.
He feeds upon her face by day and night,
And she with true kind eyes looks back on him,
Fair as the moon and joyful as the light:
Not wan with waiting, not with sorrow dim;
Not as she is, but was when hope shone bright;
Not as she is, but as she fills his dream.

Three sang of love together: one with lips
   Crimson, with cheeks and bosom in a glow,
Flushed to the yellow hair and finger tips;
   And one there sang who soft and smooth as snow
   Bloomed like a tinted hyacinth at a show;
And one was blue with famine after love,
   Who like a harpstring snapped rang harsh and low
The burden of what those were singing of.
One shamed herself in love; one temperately
   Grew gross in soulless love, a sluggish wife;
One famished died for love. Thus two of three
   Took death for love and won him after strife;
One droned in sweetness like a fattened bee:
   All on the threshold, yet all short of life.

It's a weary life, it is, she said:
Doubly blank in a woman's lot:
I wish and I wish I were a man:
Or, better then any being, were not:
Were nothing at all in all the world,
Not a body and not a soul:
Not so much as a grain of dust
Or a drop of water from pole to pole.
Still the world would wag on the same,
Still the seasons go and come:
Blossoms bloom as in days of old,
Cherries ripen and wild bees hum.

Would wake and weary and fall asleep.

But not today; it froze, and blows and snows,

Only, my secret’s mine, and I won’t tell.
Or, after all, perhaps there’s none:
Suppose there is no secret after all,
But only just my fun.
Today’s a nipping day, a biting day;
In which one wants a shawl,
A veil, a cloak, and other wraps:
I cannot ope to everyone who taps,
And let the draughts come whistling thro’ my hall;
Come bounding and surrounding me,
Come buffeting, astounding me,
Nipping and clipping thro’ my wraps and all.
I wear my mask for warmth: who ever shows
His nose to Russian snows
To be pecked at by every wind that blows?
You would not peck? I thank you for good will,
Believe, but leave the truth untested still.
Spring’s an expansive time: yet I don’t trust
March with its peck of dust,
Nor April with its rainbow-crowned brief showers,
Nor even May, whose flowers
One frost may wither thro’ the sunless hours.
Perhaps some languid summer day,
When drowsy birds sing less and less,
And golden fruit is ripening to excess,
If there’s not too much sun nor too much cloud,
And the warm wind is neither still nor loud,
Perhaps my secret I may say,
Or you may guess.

Catch at to-day, forget the days before:

In open treaty. Rise above

Her feet are steadfast; all the arduous way
That foot-track hath not wavered on the sand.

1.
I was born on a Tuesday in April.
I didn't cry. Not because I was stunned. I wasn't even mad.
I was the lucky egg, trained for gratitude
inside the belly for nine months straight.
Two workers welded bunk beds at the end
of the delivery room. One on top of the other.
My universe might have been the white lime ceiling,
or the embodiment of Einstein's bent space
in the aluminum springs of the bed above
that curved toward the center.
Neither cold, nor warm.
""It was a clear day,"" my mother told me.
It's hard to believe
there were a few romantic evenings
when I was conceived, a buzz in the retina
and red-laced magma
decadently peeling off
a silver candlestick.
Infants' cries and milk fever
turned to salt from the stench of bleach—
abrasive, unequivocal.
With a piece of cloth wrapped on the end of a stick,
the janitor casually extends the negative space
of the black-and-white tiled floor
like a mouth of broken teeth, a baleen of darkness
sieving out new human destinies.
 
 
2.
1968. At the dock, ships arriving from the East
dumped punctured rice bags, mice
and the delirium of the Cultural Revolution.
A couple of men in uniform
cleared out the church
in the middle of the night.
The locals saw the priest in the yard
wearing only his underwear, shivering from the cold.
Their eyes, disillusioned, questioned one another:
""Wasn't he the one who pardoned our sins?""
 
Icons burned in front of their eyes,
icons and the holy scriptures.
Witnesses stepped farther back,
as if looking at love letters
nobody dared to claim.
 
Crosses were plucked from graves. And from each mouth
spilled irreversible promises:
mounds of dirt the rains would smooth down
sooner or later.
 
Children dragged church bells by the tongue.
(Why didn’t they think of this before?)
Overnight, the dome was demolished, instantly revealing
a myriad of nameless stars that chased the crowd
like flies on a dead horse.
 
And what could replace Sunday mass now?
Women brought cauldrons into the yard.
Men filled up their pipes; smoke rose
into the air, against gravity's pull.
Nails in worn out shoes exposed stigmata
that bled in the wrong places—
a new code of sanctification,
of man, by man.
 
 
3.
""Read!""—I was told. Who said that?
Angel Gabriel, or my first-grade teacher
who had dark roots underneath her bleached curls?
 
Language arrived fragmentary
split in syllables, spasmodic
like code in times of war.
 
""Continue where your classmate left off!""
A long sentence tied us to one another
without connotation as if inside an idiom.
Someone would get to read the noun, another the verb,
a third one a pronoun. . .
I always got the exclamation mark at the end—
a mere grimace, a small curse.
 
A tall cast-iron stove below the portrait of the dictator,
puffing smoke from its temples, enough heat for everyone.
On the blackboard,    
leftover diphthongs from yesterday or the day before
rubbed against one another like kittens.
 
After dusk, I looked for another language outside the window,
my eyes glued to a constellation
(they call these types ""dreamers"")
my discovery possibly a journey into the past,
toward a galaxy already dead, nonexistent,
the kind of news that needs millions of years
to reach me.
 
""Read!""—the angel shook me for a third time
her finger pointing to an arbitrary word
a million light years apart from its object. (It didn't matter who
       was first).
Negative space sketched my onomatopoeic profile
of body and shadow in an accidental encounter.
 
 
4.
Language is erosive.
It makes us recluses,
a wind through the canyons
carving our paleontological eras
for everyone to read.
 
Under the revised testament of my skin
bellows a gold-cast bull, an alluring object,
a need for attention.
Then comes the unleavened bread and a last supper,
which, remarkably, is repeated several times
between ice ages.
Lower yet, Sodom.
I recognize it from the stench of sulfur.
 
I hold my nose. Freud would have done the same.
And then Cain,
a crow taught him how to bury his own brother. . .
And at the bottom,
Adam’s gentlemanlike sin
under which scientists
discover earlier epochs of famine.
 
Between unidentified layers,
wanderings in the sand, the search for a new prophet. . .
 
I try to understand my people.
Their language is plain. Some words,
were actually never uttered, like pages stuck together
in a book fresh off the press
and long after it sits on a shelf.
 
This, too, lives inside me
within insidious bubbles of air, negative
spaces where I can find little historical rest,
but also where utter ruin may originate.
 
5.
Little left of the snow three days ago.
Its blanket ripped away, exposing
dog shit and the bruises of routine.
 
Negative space gives form to the woods
and to the mad woman—a silhouette
of the goddess Athena
wearing a pair of flip flops,
an owl on her shoulder.
 
It’s minus zero. The factory’s gate gnashes its teeth
behind the back of the last worker. Blowing noses, shivering,
     mucus. . .
A virus circulates through the workplace,
secretly, intimately touching one person after another,
a current of sensuality.
It softens the tone.
But nothing unites them more than their frailty,
The one-sizes-fits-all shoes you must grow accustomed to
By filling the extra space with cotton,
Or curling your ill-fitting toes.
 
6.
In Halil’s yard,
rules were sacrilege.
His eight children entertained themselves
by carrying famine on their shoulders,
recalling St. Bartholomew’s flayed skin.
Starving, filthy, hazel-eyed—
three qualities that unexpectedly coalesce
in the bright light, strung together like sneezes.
 
One’s famine was another’s consolation.
“Look at them! It’s a sin for us to complain.
They’re even worse off than us!”
But even Halil found his own consolation
in the old woman Zyra, “barren and paralyzed,”
the root origin of despair.
 
This was our highlands landscape,
hierarchical, where each family
would make out a different expiration date
on the roof below their own.
 Schadenfreude was the only river
that could turn mills.
 
But if this hierarchy shifted,
and our roof gave signs of ruin,
my mother would plant tulips in the garden,
white tulips, our false image,
a scarecrow to keep predators away.
 
 
7.
Nearly nothing was mentioned in the letters he sent from prison,
just two lines, on top of the page:
“I am well. . .” and “If you can,
please send me a pair of woolen socks.”
 
From them, I learned to read between the lines:
negative spaces, the unsaid, gestures,
insomnia that like a hat’s shadow
fails to shade your chin and ears.
 
And in the photographs’ white background,
acrophobia adds to the color of their eyes: blue,
green, gray, and ultimately, chesnut brown,
as, earthward, we lower our gaze.
 
I learned to read the empty spaces the dead left
behind—a pair of folded glasses
after the reading’s done and discourse commences.
 
Or the musical chairs game called ""love,""
where there are less empty seats than people.
If you don’t want to be the last one standing
you must predict when the music will stop.
(Who, though, has really succeeded?)
 
Perhaps a little practice can be useful in this case.
I don’t mean squatting, jumping, stretching,
but listening to the same music every day from the start,
the same miserable vinyl record
so that you’ll recognize its cracks
before it recognizes yours.
 
 
8.
Midnight. Snoring,
meaningless sounds that stain the side of the wall
that belongs to no one.
So where are we? What dimension?
Who foots the bill at a time like this
without lambs or sinners,
when even angels record nothing?
 
The street’s clearly visible
under the neon 24-hour-service sign
above the funeral home.
There was a music shop next to it
that closed down a few months ago;
the shop shared a wall with the funeral home,
shared the same water pipes and the same gate to heaven.
But the coffins won,
the wide-shouldered coffins that narrow down
in the shape of a mummy, not a human.
Wood of the highest quality, swears the owner,
and pure silk inside, pleated like a stomach
that can digest even a bulldozer.
 
When asleep we're simply five limbs. Starfish.
If you cut one limb, it will grow back.
Even a single limb could recreate us from the beginning,
     a single hope.
Negative space is always fertile.
 
 
9.
No one knows if it was simply a matter of mixed
or some other reason why I used to see
what I wasn't supposed to see—
the ending of things.
It wasn’t a mystical gift, but like a blood clot
in the darkness of a vein, I held on to reason,
as it circulated from the bottom up
and not the other way around as we were told.
I used to start from the edges
and with my left hand or a croupier’s stick
gather the balls and dice from the corners
and then watch the bettors
as neither a winner nor a loser.
There's nothing sillier
than watching a film in reverse
where after the climax, the protagonists
are replaced by circumstances,
and circumstances replaced by minor characters,
their tongues plastered behind a single, fatal smirk
Life and my short lunar calendar slipped away
like carbon paper sending off as much light as necessary,
skipping the details, the contrast and sharp colors.
Lunar time is short. Until the actual end,
there are years enough, the negative spaces.

has already been uttered, a conclusive sentence

I grew up in a big house
where weakness and expressions of joy
deserved punishment.
And I was raised on the via politica
with the grease of yesterday’s glories,
a thick grease collected under arctic skies.
I was lit up. My notebooks, my hair, my heart reeked of
smoke.
 
That’s when we saw each other clearly.
Or rather, what remained of us.
Damaged like lottery numbers
scratched away with a blade.
 
How different we were!
 
Those with round faces were righteous;
those with narrow faces were cautious.
 
One listened secretly to Puccini,
another to silence, the music’s music.
The oldest one declaimed monologues
inside a ten-by-ten-foot cell
he had built for himself.
 
And the mysterious one
simply had diabetes.
 
But how similar we were in severe circumstances!
 
Alarmed like a flock of magpies
that the smallest stone sends into the sky
toward the mouth of the abyss.
 
Then it became obvious there wasn’t enough space for everyone.
We separated. Some went on living in via verbum,
telling of what they knew, what they witnessed,
and so, through their narrative,
creating their own grease.
 
The others crossed over the ocean.
 
And those in particular who went farthest away
never speak of their annoying history
of wretched survival, burying it
in the darkest crevices on their being.
Unfortunately, as with perfume, its scent
lingers there for much, much longer.

A little pain here,
and the effect is felt elsewhere
Once, a group of explorers set out to plant a flag on the South
      Pole,
a needle at the heel of the globe, in the middle of nowhere.
But before the mission was completed
a new world war had begun.
The impact of the needle was felt in the world’s brain,
in the lobe responsible for short-term memory.
When Russia used ideology as acupuncture—a needle over the
     Urals—
it impacted the pancreas and the control of blood sugar:
America paid tenfold for whiskey during Prohibition,
and at post offices, copies of Joyce’s
“immoral” Ulysses were stored for burning.
The universe functions as a single body. Stars form lines of
     needles
carefully pinned to a broad hairy back.
Their impact is felt in the digestive tract, each day
a new beginning. How can you begin a new day
not having fully absorbed yesterday’s protein?
I was a child when my first teacher
mispronounced my last name twice. That pricked me
      like a needle.
A small needle in the earlobe. And suddenly,
my vision cleared—
I saw poetry,
the perfect disguise.

""The wild will keep calling and calling forever in your ears. You
cannot escape the 'little voices.'""
—Frank Wild



1.
Here I rest, in South Georgia.
A few feet of evolution away
lie the graves of whale hunters, pointing north.
A white fence shields them from elephant seals
and their apocalyptic screams that each day warn
of the end of the world, or maybe the beginning. . .
 
I survived five expeditions to the Pole.
The one before last, “Imperial Trans-Antarctica,” nearly killed me.
For two years I put up with the ice—no man can reap or sow
       these fields.
And, unlike farmers, I didn’t even need to ask God for rain,
because ice is sated
and more desolate than the Sahara.
 
I survived distance. Wrote one message after another
beginning with a capital letter and a ""PS."" at the end.
My own personal post office under my pillow
closed for two years already, on holiday.
 
I survived six month-long polar days and nights;
to this day, I don't know which one was worse.
 
My epitaph is simple. Carved in granite:
                         FRANK WILD
                         18 April 1873
                         19 August 1939
                         “Shackleton’s
                          Right Hand Man”
From those cast away here
by a defect in the engine of the ship
or nostalgia of the womb.
 
2.
Ah yes. . . in the beginning was the ship. The ship stuck in ice.
      Endurance. 
Ships are women. They prefer soft seas.
In the best-case scenario, she’s called La Santa Maria 
and she throws you, like Columbus, on some foreign shore.
 
But if you get too close to her. . .
 
The very day after
we washed her deck with warm water and soap,
warmed her arteries with gin,
stroked her lower back with our surrogate songs,
shaved our beards and exposed the illiterate lines on our faces,
she took off.
 
And from the shore,
we saw how she broke her ribs, sinking,
aft first, so fast we didn’t even have time to pray,
leaving behind her ash-tree fragrance
and faux pearls on the water.
 
“Such a woman!” someone laughed bitterly,
“She knows when to leave so as not to be forgotten.”
 
3.
A woman, naturally, has no business there.
Antarctica is a masculine continent—
male penguins keep the eggs warm,
the moon stands up on the street to urinate
after being kicked out of the tavern,
the cold like a cut-throat razor, dulled for three thousand years,
and the sled dogs, the Huskies,
we kill with a single bullet
so they won’t starve to death. In this way
we instill a little character into the new land
before the arrival of Conquistadors, thieves,
assassins, missionaries, prostitutes,
the first invading army of every continent.
 
Antarctica is a man’s continent,
because only a man chooses to break into the darkness of the mind
by conquering the body,
as Amundsen and Scott did, their glory
reaching to the apex of ecstasy.
Zero degree of geographical latitude,
utter collapse.
 
4.
Hunger is overestimated. The stomach functions much like the
     brain:
when it has nothing to think about, it feeds off memories.
It can last three days just thinking of a single biscuit.
But those who have a better memory, meaning a much stronger
     acidity,
can go on for months
remembering a slice of prosciutto, two fried eggs,
sweetly folding their eyelids like napkins after a meal.
 
Then hallucinations begin. Banquets. Easter supper.
Feet move impatiently under the table;
the scent of rosemary wafts from a platter
and two clean serving hands with burns here and there.
That's when you feel grief-stricken
and you attack the seals and penguins with your
alpine knives and shoes like a madman
in an empty amphitheater.
Or is this, too, a hallucination,
and in this case not ours
but Antarctica's?
 
And when clarity finally returns,
both stomach and brain
notice only their own deep wrinkles.
 
 
5.
Blubber, blubber, seal's blubber.
Blubber that keeps your spirits alive, rendering it for fuel, for light,
blubber to mask the body's foul odor,
—a mixture of doubt, hope, and ammonia.
And if you have nothing better to do,
think of a cow's thigh hanging at the butcher's,
its delicate streak of fat
like a silk ribbon.
 
I survived even this sarcasm.
 
And every night, before bed,
we read recipes to each other
one of a few things we secretly rescued
from the ship before she sank,
as if these items were her lingerie.
 
What a show it was!
What pathos in pronouncing prosciutto, sugar, omelet!
What sensuality in milk, parsley, cinnamon!
We made these words up ourselves.
Nothing exists until its moment of absence.
 
But first, in order to warm up our mouths
like actors before going on stage,
we'd repeat mechanically, palates dry,
""Bless us, O Lord,
and this food we've received through your mercy.”
 
 
6.
It was the Romans who spoiled the word
studying rhetoric
before anatomy and mathematics:Vir bonus dicendi peritus
“The good man skilled in speaking"" (Marcus Porcius Cato)
 
But in Antarctica, words are measured differently: by calories!
With a simple greeting you lose five calories,
just as many to keep a fire burning for a full minute.
And a Ciceronian argument can consume a whole day’s
      nutrition;
think carefully before you open your mouth.
 
The word is overestimated.
 
Sometimes it’s enough to avert your eyes from your shoes
to imply “gangrene”;
and a vague exchange of glances between men
is enough to understand that the ice is cracking beneath your feet
and death is closer than your fingers.
 
7.
Stretched smooth from end to end—such is Antarctica. In fact,
even a baby’s skin looks withered by comparison.  
No emotions. No regrets. No warnings.
Either fight or die.
 
My father was like this more or less. A teacher at a village school.
In classrooms that smelled of sheep-wool pullovers
drying on the body. And eyes that moved freely
in their hollows, like toes
inside an older sibling’s shoes.
 
Unlike the Romans,
my father preached about justice and honor
his hands folded behind his back.
His shoulders seemed twice as wide
as his worn jacket.
 
I inherited his sharp, gray gaze
and his soft voice.
Eyes that say “Go” and a voice that says “Stay.”
You never know which one to trust.
 
 
8.
And mother? Oh, she was simply Captain Cook’s niece,
—the great James Cook—
from morning to night
when she washed, swept, dug potatoes from the garden,
fixed her husband’s tie on Sundays
even from her bed, while in labor.
She never spoke of this. As it wasn’t necessary.
People speak of what they have, not what they are.
 
She was a tailor. Measured everyone's perimeter with a glance;
erred only on the width of one’s neck, an unknown strength.
Her large scissors followed
the white chalk line on the cloth so precisely. ""Snip!""
She said little. Her silence followed the white outlines
of another tailor,
over a fabric much older than she was.
 
But now that I think of it,
how did the poor woman respond to her friends asking,
""Where is your son?""
""He's exploring the world.""
""And what does he bring back from there?""
""Himself, alive, I hope.""
""What's the point of returning empty-handed after two years?”
 
Was she at least a little proud of me? Of her Frank?
Certainly not. She was Captain Cook's niece.
The past always conquers.
 
 
9.
I was the first of thirteen children.
And as a rule, each of them
eyed one of my belongings.
One eyed my bed near the window
that overlooked the water where frogs lived
and asparagus grew on the shore.
Another eyed my green jacket bought with borrowed money,
poker cards, a fishing net,
my wicker chair with the damaged back.
Another whistled my favorite tune:
""What Will We Do with a Drunken Sailor?”
without reaching the refrain.
And yet another envied the basement
—that place I occupied in my father’s heart—
 with its elm door hanging by a single hinge.
 
But the time hasn't come to leave home just yet,
until your own brother begins to use your shaving kit
and dreams of the same girl.
 
 
10.
What shaving kit? Antarctica makes you grow a double-beard
as if you were a hundred-year-old grave.
And, while you remember wasting time waiting in line at
      barber's
another beard grows, a red one.
 
Here, each body part works for itself:
the stomach, hands, intestines, eyes. . .
The unity of the body is overestimated, too.
 
Only skin pulls everything together like a sled.
The skin? Which skin? Man loses his first skin
to his first love, like the snake early in spring
on a thorn-apple bush that blocks the way.
From that point on he stops counting the rest.
 
11. 
I don’t know why it was named “Elephant Island,”
when it answered the ocean with the cries of a she-wolf.
We could only make out her sly teats under her belly. After
      some time,
if she didn’t kill us first, we’d begin to cry like wolves ourselves.
 
Twenty-two people. Packed next to one another under two
      inverted boats
like notes in Bach’s “Come, Sweet Death, Come Blessed Rest,”
with more pauses, a dramatic suffocation between breaths.
A dry, calcic cough was a sign of life. Or the delirious mutterings
        of someone
dreaming aloud of “ice” in the middle of ice,
after they had cut off his toes.
 
But the hardest moment arrives in the morning,
when, with shut eyes and plugged nostrils,
as if drinking your own urine
you recycle the same lie for four months straight:
“Men, pack up your stuff! The boss might arrive today!”
 
And they obeyed me. Packed carefully each day from the start,
leaving nothing shap in the folds of their bags,
nothing that would spoil the line between fact and fiction.
 
It was a time when
routine grew more powerful than hope.
 
 
12.
Fish in the ocean toyed with our citizenship.
On the seventh mile, we left our medals behind, class ranks,
along with the dogs, potatoes, and a camera.
We made fire out of money
and kept only a single metal coin each
so that archaeologists might trace us more easily centuries later.
On Elephant Island, we had to bid farewell even to tobacco,
tobacco which reminded us of village alleyways
and walks home after midnight.
 
Time glided above us without touching a single strand of our
     hair—
nonexistent, as if gliding above ancient cities,
exposing the solemnity of our white bones
and crickets on absent walls.
 
That’s when the ten commandments deserted us:
“Do not steal,” “Do not lie,” “Do not covet,”
“Honor your parents”. . .
save one of them perhaps,
the one about the holiness of Sunday.
 
We already had nothing. We belonged to no one.
An entirely new species: HOMO ANTARCTICUS.
A scientific proof that “forgotten” and “free”
mean the same thing.
 
 
13.
Two years after returning from the world of the dead,
you find your house taken over by another tenant
and the rent tripled,
the commemorative plaque nailed to the gate:
“Here lived F.W.”
And your lover, or better, ex-lover,
for the same reason,
in the arms of another
three times more handsome.
 
You see your own image sold at an auction.
Artifact. Original. “Brrramp. Sold!” The price so high
you can’t afford it. But even if you could,
you're an illegal customer,
holding a death certificate in your hand.
 
And you find your parents turned into winter trees
their eyes fixed on a large cloud of plaster.
They don’t expect visitors. Best not disturb them.
Let their leaves fall quietly where they will
let the crow's nest remain in the armpit of a branch,
where it has always been.
 
Perhaps you should take a shortcut, start over.
Or you know what? There’s a war going on nearby, they say.
Go there instead!
But this time die better.
 
 
14.
War’s never satisfied with flesh;
Fresh, branded, smoked,
with or without blood
blue blood, dark, thick, whatever kind.
And frozen blood like yours
could store at minus 40 degrees Celsius,
viruses from 1914 unscathed,
and the map of the old Empire         
and Scott's hurt ego 
and old coins minted with the head of Edward VII,
and Browning’s poetry and the epic of the unknown,
like an envelope inside an envelope,
all making you the ideal candidate.
 
Back on the ship, ammunition everywhere,
sailing through the cold Northern seas
where you had to learn a new language.
A new language is like a fish:
first, you need to remove its spine
in order to chew it.
 
Unlike in Antarctica,
one’s purpose in war is clear: kill or be killed,
though sometimes it’s the same difference.
 
Baltic nights gave you what Antarctica refused you:
the other half of the celestial sphere.
You meet Vera, the widow of a tea plantation owner,
a character out of a Baroque novel, her pupils blurred with dusk,
and the ritual of mourning fitted perfectly to her body
like a final journey. 
 
 
15.
A man charmed by a glacier,
who knows too well the flawless forms of her body,
feels her eavesdropping gaze even when asleep,
her clean and distant breath
and her heart, a piece of ice, that melts inside a cigarette case
heated for drinking water,
finds it difficult to marry a real woman,
to marry Vera.
And Africa.
 
I bought land. Barren. Hundreds of acres. In Zululand.
I didn’t fare well with tobacco. Planted cotton instead,
chose bodily peace rather than meditation.
My nearest neighbor lived 45 miles away. White, of course.
And my fate, never blended with the blacks,
those beautiful statues, wrapped in straw.
I heard them nod off during lunch break,
like the oars of a boat,
in complete sync.
They knew where they were heading.
But I didn’t.
 
And I was right. It didn’t take long
before drought, floods, worms
destroyed everything. The bank left me only my own beard
and the malarial shadow of a baobab. Apart from other things,
Vera filled out divorce papers. The woman in the yellow dress,
yellow as quinine, yellow as the sigh of a hinge at dusk,
the woman married to the hero
who now can’t even manage a small plot of land.
 
 
16.
The man in front of me
—my master I call ""Boss""—
is newly shaved, and dressed in a striped tie and jacket
as if the Prince of Wales or Fred Astaire,
a style that arrives here two years late.
He asks me to serve whiskey to clients at the bar
and chat them up
using their jargon, gestures,
sentences uninterrupted by mosquitoes,
and the abstract rhetoric of the Depression years.
And, to be frank,
he pays me for the latter.
 
But what do I know,
what does a survivor know about the art of living,
for which new instincts are needed, new muscles
and other kinds of heart valves?
 
Furthermore,
how can I obey such a spick-and-span boss,
having known the smoky gods of Antarctica
who recognize each other solely by the nose
and can end rebellions with a glance
and count the deaths as members of the crew?
How can I take orders from a boss whose name isn't Shackleton?
 
 
17.
""Second in command,” “Lieutenant,” “Shackleton’s right hand”
 
What did she see so clearly in me,
my drama teacher in elementary school
when she'd always assign me the role of Father Joseph,
of Gaspar the Magi offering Jesus frankincense,
or of John the Baptist always there to clear the path?
What did she see in my metallic pupils, baritone voice,
      infrequent speech
as if scissors, bandage, and iodine
inside a first aid kit?
 
Under Antarctica's naked sky, each of us followed his own star.
Even the carpenter, his own heraldic calling.
You didn’t need much to feed them;
 just a few crusts of insomnia and the tents' punctured holes.
 
My star was weak; you could hardly see it
hidden behind another larger, troubled star
like a calm valley that appears behind jagged peaks
more attractive when absent.
 
 
18.
What happened afterward can be told in a few words:
I worked in a mine; earth’s warm heart,
happened to be crueler than her frozen brain.
I laid railroad tracks South, always toward the Unknown.
It was like playing only two strings on a violin: joy and sorrow,
fatefully blending at the horizon.
 
I repaired houses. Another waste of time.
I never understood their weak points,
just as you can't make out eyes from genitals or mouth
in some underwater creatures.
 
And when I was left penniless,
I gave lectures about Antarctica,
water gurgling in my gullet every five words, for those few
who listened patiently to an adventure of survival.
 
Then Bea arrived. Or sweet Beatrice.
It was easy to grant her what I had left in my heart
—that set of heavy museum keys—
with no fear she might lose them.
 
Tired lungs and liver
could barely follow my split image
of bust and bottle of booze.
Like a prophet in the last circle of Dante’s Inferno,
I carried my own decapitated head in hand.
 
My ashes were lost at the base of a church. No one
      thought of them.
It was a time of war. Another world war. The second
one not knowing what to do with her own ashes either.
 
19.
Some of us died in the war.  Others took to the sea again,
the gray, cracked waters of the South,
decks perspiring fuel and alcohol.
Our random itineraries. Full-time melancholics.
 
For months in Antarctica,
we waited for our shadow to return
and consumed that question you ask yourself only once in your
     lifetime,
the way one consumes chickenpox.
 
And the rest of the time,
we counted the scars left on our faces,
with a gesture you could call indifferent and epic,
or childlike.

You can't fake it. You know when I fail
          to achieve the expected: palm the becoming-
                         comatose bullfrog, legs collapsing as they may,
and chuck it (we used to say) high as you can.
 
Let it fly stone-like to the skylight in the low
          dome of fog—another requirement of the game:
                    a foggy day and a bullfrog and you, Vincent.
The old code goes back and forth between us
 
as we take our turns, childhood pals, engaged
           by the game we once called Kamikaze—now,
                         a nameless ceremony. Nameless not because
a boy's play calcifies in a man's conviction;
 
not because, despite our promise, you've become
          a mid-rank fighter pilot, and I a minor poet;
                        and not because it's too unpleasant to name
what brings to hand that astonished muscle
 
only to leave it, later, sprawled on the current.
          The perfect toss sends the critter shattering

Disappearance is success. Once you said, ""My insides
 
tickle whenever it happens,"" and so I know

The name is gone because we're from here,
 
and, being native, cannot visit how it is
         that an urge to which we tend tends to us—
                       how we are cruel, inscrutable, indefensible,
yet holy. How we send up bodies of praise from
 
our right hand, only to gather eventual elegies—
          flesh stunned still as words—in our left.
                    Once again the center of the heavens
is earth. We've thrown as high as we can
 
for as long as we can remember, only to await
          some return: a revelation, plummet, explosive
                         splash. So it is that two grown men
may stand again in stillness, awaiting word,
 
friends who glimpse for seconds at a time
          earth as it is in heaven, ankle-deep

Teach me while I can bear the affliction—
     do not, Lord, despise my plea;
before I've become my own burden
     and the little I am weighs on me,
and against my will, I give in
     as worms eat bones that weary of me.
 
I'll come to the place my forefathers reached,
     and by their place of rest find rest.
Earth's back to me is foreign;
     my one true home is in its dust.
Till now my youth has done what it would:
     When will I provide for myself?
 
The world He placed in my heart has kept me
     from tending to my end and after.
How could I come to serve my Lord,
     when I am still desire's prisoner?
How could I ask for a place on high,
     when I know the worm will be my sister?
 
How at that end could my heart be glad,
     when I do not know what death will bring?
Day after day and night after night
     reduce the flesh upon me to nothing.
Into the winds they'll scatter my spirit.
     To dust they'll return the little remaining.
 
What can I say—with desire my enemy,
     from boyhood till now pursuing me:
What is Time to me but your Will?
     If you're not with me, what will I be?
I stand bereft of any virtue:
     only your justice and mercy shield me.
 
But why should I speak, or even aspire?
     Lord, before you is all my desire.

head bowed despite not being tall

Cotton curtains, stone walls, the smell of burnt lime
take him back to the moment
the cold war ended.
 
The other day his sheet was hung up in the courtyard

Faces tarnished by sun

“What did you dream of last night?”

                    Biography of LeBron as Ohio
                ","
When is a poem one word? Even at 17 he was Baraka
           on the court, Coltrane gold toned, a kind of running riff,
more than boy-child, man-child, he was one word like Prince.
            How back in those drunken days when I still
ran in bars & played schoolyard ball
            & wagered fives & tens, me & my colleague
the psych-prof drove across Eastern Ohio
             just to see this kid from powerhouse St. Vincent,
grown out of rust-belt-bent-rims, tripped
            with the hype & hope & hip hop
blaring from his headphones, all rubber soled
            & grit as the city which birthed him.
We watched him rise that night scoring over 35,
            drove back across the quiet cut cornfields
& small towns of Ohio, back to the places
            where we slept knowing that Jesus had been reborn, black
& beautiful with a sweatband crown rimming his brow.
            He was so much more than flipping burgers & fries,
more than 12-hour shifts at the steel plant in Cleveland.
            More than the shut-down mill in Youngstown.
More than that kid selling meth in Ashtabula.
            He was every kid, every street, every silo, he was white
& black & brown & migrant kids working farms.
            He was the prince of stutter-step & pause. He was the new
King. We knew he was coming back the day after he left
            his house in Bath Township. He never sold it.
Someone fed his fish for years. Perhaps our hope? Fuck Miami.
Leave Wade to wade through the Hurricane rain. LeBron is
remembering that woman washing the linoleum floor, that man
          punching his punch card. He drives a Camaro, the cool kid
Ohio car driving through any Main Street. He is the toll-taker, &
            he is the ticket out.
He keeps index cards documenting
            his opponents’ moves. One leans forward before he drives.
One always swipes with his left hand. The details like a preacher
            studying the gospel. He studies the game like a
mathematician conjugating equations, but when he moves he is a
            choreography,
a conductor passing the ball like a baton. He is a burst of cinders
            at the mill. He is a chorus of children calling his name.
            The blistered hands of man stacking boxes
in Sandusky, the long wait for work in Lorain.
A sapling bends
            & reaches in all directions
before it becomes a tree. A ball is a key to a lock.
            A ball is the opposite of Glock.
America who sings your praises,
           while tying the rope, everyone waiting for Caesar to fall,
back-stabbing media hype city betrayed
            by white people with racist signs.
            I watch the kids play ball
in the Heights, witness this they say. We will rise. I watched
            LeBron arrive & leave, I walked, I gave up drinking
as he went off & won a ring. The children’s chorus calls out sing
            brother, sing. Everything is black. Storm clouds gather
out on Lake Erie. But the old flower-hatted women
            at the Baptist church are heading out praise cards,
registering teenagers to vote. To turn a few words into a sentence.
He is a glossary of jam, & yes he is corporate
            chugging down green bubbly Sprite, running in Beats head
phones, he is Dunkin his donut, he is Nike, witness, ripped.
            On a spring day in Akron a
            chorus of children is chanting his name on the court by the
chain-link fence. He is forged steel, turning his skinny body into
            muscle, years of nights lifting, chiseling, cutting, studying.
Watching the tape. To make a new kind of sentence. He is passing
            out T-shirts, this long hot bloody summer he was returned
to the rusted rim along the big lake. He is stutter-step. He is
            spinning wheel. He has a cool new hat. He is speaking of dead
black children. He is giving his time. To make the crowd
            sway like wind through a field of corn.
            Does LeBron think of dying?
            Does the grape think of dying as it withers on the vine by
the lake? Or does it dream of the wine it will become?
He is wearing a shirt that says I Can’t Breathe.
They said he was arrogant. I said he was just Ohio.
            He married his high school sweetheart. Bravado laid out
on the court. No back down, he is Biggie with a basketball inside
            of a mic, no ballistics, just ballet. He is Miles Davis cool,
quietly cerebral, turning his back, tossing up
            chalk like blue smoke, blue notes, blues. He is Akron,
Columbus, he is heart & Heat turned to lake effect blizzards,
            freighters frozen in ice, looking for work & no money to eat.
He is Ashtabula & Toledo. He is carrying so many across the
            river, up through Marietta.
            The grapevines are ripe in Geneva.
            He returns, Man-child, Man-strong, Man-smart, Man-
mountain, Mansfield to East Akron, minus into Man, or should we
            say Mamma raised? Single mother fed, shy child, quiet child
who grew, who suffered & taught his body to sing, his
            mother worked how many shifts, doing this, doing that,
never gave up for her son. He is third shift at the rubber
            plant in winter, he is farm hands & auto parts piecework
& long nights the men at the bar, eyes on the television.
            The lake tonight is black as newly laid asphalt.
There are no ellipses. He is turning paragraphs
            into chapters. Long ago the hoop Gods made this deal
at the crossroads, Old Scratch is flipping the pages
            of his program & waiting high in the stands—to belong to a
place most people would call
            nowhere, to show the world how tough we truly are,
twelve-hour shifts at the Rubber plant in Akron. How he is, how
            he is a part of this asphalt court we call Ohio, & how we
suffer, & how we shine.

He shows me photos—two loves lost, one
a married man—then on the way down,
pauses before a feather in a box,
reciting Yeats’s “Leda and the Swan.”
He begins to weep at Let her drop, adds,Like Welty’s loves! Now I stop—
is he comparing her to the god, or Leda?
He cannot bear her, her Unfulfilled Love.
I cannot bear this either—how dare he conjure up
for her such disappointment, such wasted longing?
I want to be the mirror of her photographs,
to be her figure of my own conjuring. I want

I.
Serious smiles a lot.
At least that’s what they say,
His Mum and Pop
Trying to be proud
As all the nurses gather round
To squint into the cloud
Of little Serious on the ultrasound.It’s likely just the way he’s bent,
The head nurse finally thunders
Into the awe and argument
Swirling through the crowd
Where someone mutters half-aloudIn all my years…
 
Serious never hears.
Serious spins and spins
With his dumb dolphin grin
In the best bed there is,
Where there’s no guilt and no sin,
No child more inner than this;
Nothing to will
And nothing to want,
No body you both are and haunt;
No drug of disappointment
Or feeling that there’s never now
(Or do these seep in somehow?);
No suffering the world’s idiocy
 
Like a saint its pains;
No traffic and no planes;
No debts, no taxes,
No phones and no faxes;
No rockslide of information
Called the Internet.
 
Serious isn’t. Yet.
 
 
2.
Serious hears a sound.
Not unusual, in itself, nothing to be concerned about.
Here and there there’s been a shout,
A song he seemed to be inside,
The weird whale-calls of her gas.
This, too, shall pass.
 
Then it comes again,
And with a far-off force
Which a shrink less serious than he
Will have him dream is a drain
That all his impurity
Is slowly drifting toward(Down, Serious says, down!) 
Beyond which he’ll be clean,
Feel no pain…
 
Then the dark erupts in a rain
Of blood and muck
He seems to mostly be,
Holding on for all he’s worth,
Which isn’t much, finally,
Little wizened thing
Plopping out to an earth
Where cries of agony
Dwindle to equivocal joy(It’s, it’s…is it a boy?) 
And some clear world lies
Just beyond the eyes
You can’t quite open;
 
And everything is wet,
And loud, and broken;
And all of life is one huge tit
You’re meant to somehow suck.
 
Serious staggers to his feet,
Slaps himself harder than the doctor did
And says, I’m fucked.
 
 
3.
Serious is learning silence
In the way most children learn to speak.Poshlust!
He gasps after his first feeding,Götterdämmerung in his first dusk,
His whole body writhing with a kind of violence
As if the world had wounded him,
Words his bleeding.
 Anomie, Deus absconditus
Drift into the air above his crib;Accursed progenitor, quintessence of dust
Dribble with the pap onto his bib;
As day by day, and week by week,
Serious wrestles with this difficult gift,
Forgetting, which, it seems, he is on this earth to do.
 Boob, ass, oaf,
Riving out of him like greatness going off;Ninny, crackpate, clunkhead, gorm,
Leaving him gasping and bent;fragments, sheep, rabble,
All falling, falling from him
Backwards into babble...
 
Finally Serious lies there, spent,
Language like some immense ghostly mobile
Bobbing just above his bed,
All power of movement gone as well:
 
Useless little buglike arms, buglike little fingers,
This heavy, heavy head.
 
And now if there’s something Serious can’t quite taste,
Or if he feels too acutely his own waste,
Or knows too acutely what he can’t tell,
He screams and screams
Until the world knows what Serious means.
 
 
4.
Serious goes to school.Just try it, his Mum says
As she lets go his hand
And wipes a last glaze
Of doughnut from his nose,
And Serious, insofar as Serious can,
Does give it a good try,
Though it’s hard to understand
Why they keep taking a break
From taking breaks, or why
They can’t simply walk
In line down the hall,
Or what, finally, is at stake
In a game of kickball.
 
It’s time to draw a tree.
What a relief to work alone,
Serious thinks, as he picks a scab
For just the right tinge of sky,
Breaks his sugar cookie
To make a place of stone,
And fashions out of bread
A man with a huge head
And huge, ruined wings,
Gasping at all the ruined things
To which he’s tumbled.
And calls it: Cookie, Crumbled.
 Oh my, the teacher says
When she walks by,Those are interesting trees. 
Serious closes his eyes and sees
As in a vision of doom
Himself drowning in schools,
A whole ocean of fools
Nipping, nipping at him
With their tiny, tiny teeth.
And Serious sighs
With a prophet’s wisdom
As he climbs up into his seat,
Stares out across the room
And like a prophet cries:You’re all going to die!
 
The class is a tomb.
Serious, rigid, waits.
A girl in pigtails giggles,
Then another near the back.
And as if along a fuse
The giggling goes
Up and down the rows
Till someone makes a crack
About his coat and tie
And the laughter detonates.
 
Serious climbs slowly down
Into that inferno of sound
Which the teacher’s shouts
Are only driving higher,
Packs up his lunchbox, his dignity,
And his copy of Sartre,
 
And strides with a prophet’s gaze
Through all that derisive fire.
Only once does he turn,
Briefly, to look back through the blaze
At the iron fact of his art,
Smaller from here, but unburned.
 
 
5.
Serious loves his Mum.
And then he doesn’t, quite.
It’s that way with everything—
Baths and plums,
The blessèd silence of night.
 Would you like to help with this?
His mother asks
As she rolls out biscuit dough
And cuts it with a glass
Or folds the clothes
Still warm from the sun.
But Serious knows
He was born with a task,
And though he touches the clothes
And tastes the dough,
Serious says, No.
 
Serious stays in the bath
Until his skin is shriveled and cold,
Eats himself sick on plums,
Feels in the dark
The dark he becomes,
And cries out in the night for his Mum.
 
 
6.
Serious is older now.
He just is.Thank God, Serious says,
For whom childhood, that stupid carousel that never stops,
Always had an element of disingenuousness:
The tristesse of lollipops,
The sham of naps;
Fools dandling you on their laps
So you can play horsey, which damn sure isn’t serious;
And all that endless business
Of pretending to be curious
About the most obvious things:
What’s night? Where’s Mama-Cat?
What’s wrong with Pop? Can God die?
Why, why, why?
 
To hell with that,
Serious thinks, as he sits incinerating memories
One by one,
Saying their names as he feeds them
Like photographs to a fire:
Here he is in a baseball uniform
Squinting back the sun;
Here in a blue tuxedo with a ruffled front;
And here, Lord, with pimples.
He pauses a moment.
Do memories have names?
And what, exactly, are these flames?
To hell with that!
Done.
 
Serious owns a car, pays taxes,
Contemplates a pension,
Has a crease of gray along his temples,
But he is young, young.
He develops headaches, begins sleeping badly, and relaxes,
You might say, into the constant tension
That he really always was,
With far, far too much to do
To look anywhere but onward,
Or to answer the questions of a child
With anything true.
 
 
7.
Serious isn’t Stupid,
Though they go to the same gym.
Serious sees him dropping weights
Or picking his butt and thinks,
At least I’m not him.
Nor is he Mean or Vain,
Those chiseled twins
With matching boots and belts,
Nor Smug who notes their sins,
Nor Shallow noting something else;
He isn’t useless Timid
Who no matter what won’t complain,
Nor fat-assed Nice sweating honey
On all the machines,
Nor Self-Loathing who smudges mirrors,
Nor Whacked who licks them clean.
Serious isn’t Funny.
 
Serious spreads his towel on the bench,
Sits down in front of his own image,
And Serious strains at a serious weight.
And never, not once, when he’s seen
In myriad mirrors around the room
That everyone else is straining too,
Has he caught himself too late
And finished with a roar
And more strength
Than he’s ever had before:I AM NOT YOU!
 
 
8.
Serious has a date with Doom.
It’s not the first, and seems unlikely to be the last,
For they get on quite well, Doom and he,
Share similar pasts
And similar ideas about what life should be.
It seems, in fact, that this might just bloom.
 
And what a relief.
After Morose and Mad and Neurotic;
After almost falling for Grief,
Who was so exotic
She made all the others seem tame.
Then to discover she even lied about her name.
And to sleep with another Serious! That was odd,
Like wrestling with an angel,
Though it was hard to tell from that rough unsated tangle
Which one was Serious, and which one God.
 
But how easy it is to be himself with Doom,
Serious thinks, as he puts the wine in to chill
And sets two glasses on a tray,
Who always wants whatever Serious wants
And always agrees with what he has to say;
Who doesn’t need to hear that whole spiel
About “going too fast” or “needing more room”;
And who doesn’t probe and pry that long needle into his brain
—What do you feel? What do you feel?—
Until it’s all Serious can do not to stand up and scream: Pain!
 
Lucky to be alive.
And if he still has no clear idea where she lives,
And never knows quite when she’ll arrive,
Still, something about Doom feels right
To Serious, and he looks forward to their dates.
He checks himself in the mirror, dims the light,
And waits.
 
 
9.
Serious is a traveler.
“Traveling broadens the mind,”
The man beside him says,
His tray table down and seat reclined
Even as they're taking off,
And Serious, who has his eyes closed
So he can do what Serious does,
Begins to cough.
 
               What do they say, what do they fear, 
               Is this song joy or grief? 
               This is a man, this is a god. 
               Who are you and why are you here? 
               To leave, to leave.
 
The meal is over,
Which Serious declined.
In the shell-roar of the cabin
He eases somewhat, is surprised to find
He could almost drift away.
“What line of work are you in?”
He hears the man beside him say,
And Serious begins coughing wildly again.
 
               What is that smell, what was that sound, 
               Isn’t that ice on the wings? 
               This is the air, there is the water, 
               But what do you do on the way down? 
               You scream, you scream.
 
How far they must have gone by now,
That old familiar world miles behind,
The man eats an orange,
And now he eats the rind.
He eats his plate, his plastic fork, chews
With animal relish his Styrofoam cup,
Leans over to eat bittersweet Serious too,
Who startles and wakes up.
 
               Look at the desert, look at the green, 
               Is there an end to that ice? 
               Here is a place, and here is a place, 
               But what is the space between? 
               It’s life, it’s life.
 
 
10.
Serious is married.
What a weird wind this is,
He thinks, so still at times,
Then stinging the eyes to tears.
And how he seems both more and less
Himself, and how it seems at once all of loneliness
And something he can hold.
Or is it he who's being carried?
He shivers, and reaches out for her again.
Or is it she who reaches, she who's cold?
What is this wind?
Where are these years?
 
 
11.
Serious experiences loss.
Just like that.
Flat.
Serious experiences loss,
 
As if he’d come to some sheer cliff
There was no way around,
No way to cross,
And found,
On the other side
Of a deep canyon, himself,
Experiencing loss.
 
Serious, when the man is gone,
Tells himself that he tried,
Tells himself that he cried and cried
For all he was worth
To the man sitting on the other side
Experiencing loss,
Who one day simply vanished, or moved on,
Or slipped off the edge of the earth
And died.
 
 
12.
Serious doesn’t speak French.
This embarrasses Serious,
Because insofar as he lives anywhere,
Serious lives in Paris.
 
He feels the city stare,
Feels himself sweat, and shake, as he tries to wrench
The little that he’s gleaned
Into the lot that he desires;
Feels shopkeepers look at him as if he were a liar,
Waiters as if he were unclean;
 
And feels, in truth, not at all serious,
As if he had a huge balloon for a head
And helium squeaks for a voice,
As if gravity could be merely a choice
He were making, and he might instead
Simply stop, let go, and drift away.
 
Finally Serious, opposed to epiphanies,
Has one he can’t resist.
He is Serious, and to be Serious
Is to know something utterly or not at all,
And to know, moreover,
That as you let your half-knowledge fall
From you, it does not exist.
 
Just like that Serious is himself again,
Saying weighty things
About the flowers in the stalls,
Pondering a splendid mirage
Called the Seine.
 
And if he wakes saying fromage,
Or in some shop feels
Right on the verge of translating please,
Serious knows it’s a dream,
And knows from childhood what to do.
Point and scream
Until the damn fools give you cheese.
 
 
13.
Serious has some culture.
He knows some things.
And if, as he begins to speak,
He should feel the immense wings
Of ignorance shadowing him, that dirty vulture
That squawks in drawl and drips tobacco juice,
Serious knows what shelter to seek.
 
Pick a name and Bach is better.
Modernism was powerful but diffuse.
Life’s drained out of pictures since the Renaissance.
Technique! Technique! Technique!
And about all that spastic flatulence
Called contemporary art,
Well, Serious hardly knows where to start.
 
Serious sits through opera without a yawn,
Chews up books on which weaker teeth would shatter;
He can tell you where one brushstroke lies,
List the reasons courtly love is gone,
Pluck the speck of subject matter
From Henry James.
Serious knows some things.
 
He thinks and thinks and thinks
Until his ignorance shrinks
To the tiniest of flies
Alighting somewhere in the Louvre.
Carefully, carefully, Serious creeps
With his massive swatter,
Saying, Don’t move. Don’t move.
 
 
14.
Serious believes in nothing.
It’s a nice day, what should we do?
What are you thinking?
What’s been bothering you?
What’s that you’re drinking?
 
Serious spreads the paper on his lap
To confirm what’s new under the sun,
Hears a tap, tap, tap 
Against the windowpane.
 Nothing ventured, nothing gained,
Floats up from childhood like a bit of ash,
And Serious, pausing, can almost see
His old preacher, that atom bomb of idiocy
Who every Sunday would explode.
Still, Serious thinks, there’s a truth to set you free.
But who could survive the blast?
 Tap, tap, tap.
 
Serious skims the sports pages,
Reads about a storm that rages
Far out at sea.
Some talking dog is taking office,
Some country wiping out monuments, expunging its past.
 Tap, tap, tap.
 Goddammit, Serious says, midway through a war,
And thinks again of that old bore
Who talked and talked and talked
Until you felt your head loll and sway
Like some huge flower on a tiny stalk
That one good breeze would break;
 
And how you’d see him afterwards eating chicken fried steak,
Chicken fried man,
With a tiny transistor radio in his hand
So he could listen to the football game;
And how his face seethed and writhed with what seemed pain
If he saw you coming to his booth,
And he stared off as if some great truth
Were finally, finally coming clear in that chicken fried brain
And like a prophet he was going to stand up and shout—
Until what plopped innocuously out
Was your own name.
 Tap, tap, tap.
 
Serious puts aside the news of the day
And walks to the only window there is.
But there’s no wind, not even the grass stirs.
And anyway, there’s no tree.
Serious shrugs and turns away.
Must just be me.
 
 
13.
Serious sees a child
In the playground across the street,
Sees his huge stupid head and huge stupid feet
As he tries to keep up with the games,
And hears his sonar screams
Of delight amid the other children's screams,
And hears his timid weeping when they call him names.
 
Serious sees the child standing apart sometimes
Driveling to himself in silly rhymes,
And sees him pretend to look intently at the sky
If Serious walks by,
Or sees him simply stop and stare.
 
Gradually Serious starts seeing the child everywhere,
In a store standing in an aisle,
In the subway while
Serious is trying to work on the way home,
Or laughing with his family in a restaurant
Where Serious eats alone.
 
Serious knows the truth.
This child wants something, his whole nature is want.
And it begins to be annoying,
This novice cringing, all the imbecilic and cloying
Tactics of being cute,
The whole hangdog way he has of panhandling pity
With his freckles and his missing tooth,
Sitting all fidgety in his Sunday suit
Or babbling happily as he’s leaking snot;
 
And then the air he suddenly puts on of being serious
When it’s so obvious he’s not.
 
Serious sees the child in the playground
Standing to the side,
Sees his face whiten and his eyes go wide
As Serious crosses the street and strides
Until his shadow swallows the child
And leans down close enough for them to kiss.I don’t have time for this,
Serious says,I’ve got too much to do.
 
And the child says, Who are you?
 
 
16.
Serious kills himself.No, no,
Shivering out of a dream,
Starlight and the hard glitter
Under the bridge’s beam,
Serious, Serious,
Don’t go.
 
Serious crawls out of bed,
Feels the cold in the floor
And thinks, suddenly, of lovely Mad
(Where can she be?)
Who’d bolt out of sleep and screamFarmers get up at four!
It’s three.
 
Serious makes himself a cup of coffee,
Which he doesn’t drink;
Tries and fails to read,
Tries and fails to think.
Serious sits, and holds himself still,
Minute by minute;
Until the dawn finally comes
And he is in it.
 
 
17.
Serious lives alone.
It’s better this way, he tells himself,
As he takes a pan from the pan shelf,
A spatula from the spatula drawer,
And fries two eggs the way he likes them:
Yolks of stone.
 
No more gnats of chatter over breakfast.
No more breakfast. It’s noon.
No one prancing by with only panties on
When he’s almost, almost broken through,
Or singsonging outside his doorSerious, O Serious, where are you?
No more!
 
But what, finally, does Serious do?
He sits, ignores the ringing phone,
Looks at a wall
On one of the last warm days of the year,
And settles back into the lifelong call
Of being serious,
Which is to see, within that whiteness,
Leaves being gently blown,
And to feel their colors as they fall.
 
 
18.
Serious gives a speech.
He sets his papers on the podium,
His glass within easy reach,Tap, tap, taps the microphone.
How vast this venue is.
How absolute this darkness.
 To be serious is to be alone!
Serious cries out with a triumphant look on his face,
Waiting for the echoes to end
Out there in all that space,
Which the words at once define and extend.
It takes a while, but they do die.
The spotlight lasers in.
He blinks hard, starts again.
 To know in every hand another’s touch, To hear a silence words only intensify, To feel not too little but too much This attenuated world—
 
Serious begins to sweat,
Feels the back of his shirt grow wet;
Looks down to see his papers swirled
And scattered, the glass on the floor, broken.
What’s with this fucking light, he thinks,
Or was it spoken?
He glares out at the dark, impassive crowd
And as if by force he could make them wake
Hears his voice growing loud:
 Whatever you most treasure you will break, Whatever you hold closest you will let go, There is no place that you will not leave! But to be serious—
                                  Serious says,
Quietly now, because he has them, they are his—
 To be serious, to be truly serious, is to know That what you call your losses you cannot grieve, For it was never quite these things that you wanted—This treasure, this touch, this one place—But by such life to be haunted.
 
Brilliant!
No notes, no flaws.
Serious stands back and waits for applause.
The hall is silent, utterly silent,
The heat tropic.
 
Serious looks around, confused,
Turns to the man who introduced him
Then can’t remember being introduced;
And even given his credentials,
This suddenly seems a most unlikely topic.
 
Serious tries to get out of the light,
But the light goes where Serious goes.
He blunders to the edge of the stage,
A cliff
Breaking off into a dark
in which there's no movement, no voices, not one sigh.
 
Serious feels the rage
Draining out of him, and feels a chill, and whispers,Where am I?
 
 
19.
Serious nears an end.
It’s cold and getting colder,
And Serious, older,
Sits outside thinking of his good friend,
Who like so much of Serious is gone,
And thinking of that godforsaken dawn
After the one night of his life he spent outdoors.
 Tell me,
His good friend said
When Serious staggered out to the fire,Which form would you say is higher,Tragedy or comedy?
 
And Serious, who had stumbled full-bladdered
In the night from a dream of bears,
Then dreamed himself the object
Of a dozen hungry stares,
Who had swiveled, pissed into the tent,
And sworn such things it would take a life to repent,
Serious, exhausted Serious,
Was silent.
 Because it’s been troubling me,Serious, that the answer can only be tragedy.To be conscious is to be conscious ofLosing whatever it is that you most love,And thus an art that's truly greatWill always have one deepest truth to tell,Which is, my friend, this life is hell.
 
Serious looks at the sky. It’s late.
A small wind blows
The trees, and Serious, shivering, knows
He should head inside,
That he is not well.
But sitting here, letting his eyes close,
Serious can almost see that lake
Aflame with the early sun, and smell
The sweet burn of that wood,
And feel the way it seemed his heart would surely break
Were it not for the strange lightness in his head
As his friend smiled and said,But maybe earth is the heaven of the good.
 
 
20.
Serious talks to God.
There’s no one else left.
His mind is mash,
His world is ash,
And Serious occasionally forgets himself,
Though he is not, not Bereft,
That sniveling idiot two doors down
Who sits up late
With only ashes in the grate
And talks to God.
 See? Serious says. See?Nothing.
Serious spreads his arms magnanimously
As if to give God the floor.
God declines.Thou know’st the first time that we smell the airWe wawl and cry,
Serious says, louder than before.And then we wawl and cry some more,And then we die,And then we rot!
Again he waits in case
There’s disagreement. There’s not.
 
Serious scoffs, goes to brush his teeth,
Forgets briefly to avert his eye
From the mirror’s glare
And finds his father there,
 
That gentle baffled man
Who, when there was no hope,
When he couldn’t even stand,
Carved from a piece of soap
A silly yellow duck
And set it in a little yellow dish.
Serious feels a tingling in his hair
And mutters something close to a prayer,I wish, I wish...
 
The lights go out.Goddammit, Serious shouts
As he trips and falls
To his knees on the floor,
Banging his head on the door
As he tries to rise.GodDAMMIT! Serious cries.
 
The lights come on.
His father’s gone,
But there, at the edge of the sink,
Balances the little duck in the little dish
No serious person would ever keep.
Serious tries to think,
Steadies himself as if at some brink,
Decides he needs sleep,
That’s what he needs,
Crawling fully clothed into his bed
And pulling the covers to his chin
Because, it seems, there’s some strange wind
 
That’s somehow gotten inside.
So unlike Serious,
To leave a door unclosed.
 
Yet here it is, gathering strength
As it blows his books
On the floor and it blows
Right through his body and it blows
Behind and below and above
And out of the whirlwind a voice cries
 
                    Love
 What? Serious says, as he tries
To sit upright and looks
Wildly around him,
Raising his fist in the air.The things...I have lost—
 
Immediately he is tossed
Back against the wall
By the force of a storm
That has no source, no form,
And hears again the call
Out of nowhere:
 
                    Love
 My God! Serious screams,
Unable to help himself,What maundering politician,What decerebrated pop star, What stupid puling poet Couldn’t tell me that? 
Struggling to get out of bed
He starts to cough, then choke,
A riot in his heart,
A riot in his head
As he falls off the edge to the floor.Who do you think you are, 
He gasps. Is this... Is this some sort of JOKE?
 
Suddenly the strange wind is quiet,
But no less strange the calm that comes after.
 I’m serious, the voice says.
 
And Serious dies of laughter.
 
 
EPILOGUE
The dead man’s famous.
No one now remembers him alive,
Or knows his name, or anything he did.
Still, a few stories survive
After all this while
Of a weird-looking man
With a weird-looking smile
That had, it’s said,
Almost a kind of life to it,
Though the man was seriously dead.
 
And some remember how all the flies
Vanished for miles;
And some say no, no, but the buzzards had weird smiles
As if they knew something.
And some tell of an old woman
Who would come and whisper in the dead man’s ear,
And smooth the dead man’s hair,
And if the door opened, disappear.
There are even stories of that grim mortician
Who thought the smile undignified
And tugged and tugged so hard
He slipped and fell inside
Right on top of the dead man,
Whose lips, he swore, seemed to soften,
Seemed to somehow kiss.
And some remember this:
Before the lid was sealed on that coffin
And the nails driven,
There were on that face real tears.
And some say he smiled like a man forgiven.
 
The dead man never hears.
The dead man spins and spins
With his dumb dolphin grin
Through all the places where he is
When people talk of him again:
In classrooms or in planes,
In boredom or in pain;
In front of screens
Or in the spotlight’s glare;
In days too mild to bear
And in the long nights where
The dark grows steep,
The wind wild,
And a mother rises from her sleep
To calm her serious child.

It is not pain that holds me back, but time
With its sad prefigurations and smell,­­­
Its flowers and echoes, rivers and crime.
Even now, without a future, I tell
Myself lies in future tense. As my hair
Thins, I collect combs. When clocks chime, I groan.
The falling world finds pleasure in despair
Because to suffer means to be alone,
And I suffer through all the accidents
Of change as though I were settling a score,
As if to disinvent what death invents.
I once built a castle, now I do chores.
To pass the time I rearrange my things.
To fall asleep I recite names of kings.

Love of air and water
Joined in apprehension,
Perhaps you know what's there
By way of fear, for while
 
Living in pursuit of
And going always forth
Toward something that trembles.
Its knowledge is your mind.
 
What do you think about
The great ocean's sullen
Aristocrats—these small
Headaches and dark affairs
 
That bathe themselves in your
Staging grounds, where you go
To contemplate how what
You want became your mind?
 
The black oblivion
Offers no reprieve for
You, hunter—in its keep
Your ears have grown too sharp,
 
So sharp you almost hear
Your own heartbeat over
The subtle whispers of
Water’s dismal gardens.
 
Everything about you
Is overblown, even
Your mouth is uniquely
Talented at its tasks,
 
Gathering for slaughter
Animals in their sleep,
Speaking without a sound.
Noah had seven laws,
 
You have only one—eat
To build life out of death,
Survive above all things.
The fatalistic moon
 
Filtered down upon you
Seems an imitation
Of lives you will not live.
Would you be its hero?
 
Would you call out against
The morning’s weaving light
That shames the night before
The passing of its cool?
 
Would you be at the beach
When the invisible
Becomes a glow, to surprise?
Inland, workers dreaming
 
Of unitarian
Proposals lose no sleep
To fear about your mouth.
It is their wayward friends,
 
Who wandered too far west
Into fevered chaos,
That wake up with your name
As screams exploding dreams.
 
The inland ether holds
Clouds in your dismal shape.
Lucky are those who know
Nothing, who cannot see
 
Hell outlined in vapor.
Somewhere a piano
Plays a sorrowful song
Half-written by the hate
 
That a grieving loved one
Would stick into your heart.
Such are the arts of men.
Beware. Your time is near.
 
Someone has learned lessons
You didn’t mean to teach.
A crowd is gathering.
Your skull is their kingdom.

Because the only view we have is the one
that looks down on the knees. Praise perspective.
Praise shared disdain. Praise space made by connective
tissue; the synaptic cleft; elbowroom
at the dinner table; polite conversation;
lies you push through your teeth. Because dissecting
a dog's heart won't change the way it thinks. Praise redirected
traffic. Praise the gnarled lip that defends
the gentle bones. Because your mother was
a seahorse. And to think of her thin is
to empty all the ice from the tea glasses;

For Alma Banda Goddard



my cynical feet ambled
prepared for indigestion
& blank faces of outrageous innocence
knowing I'd have to walk over years of media
declaring we're vanished or savage or pitiful or noble
My toes twitched when I saw so few brown faces
but really when one eats racism every time one goes out one’s door
the appeal of talking about it is minuscule
I sat with my back to the wall facing the door
after I changed the chairs to a circle
This doesn't really protect me
but I con myself into believing it does
One of the first speakers piped upI'm only here because my friend is Black & wantedme to do this with herI've already done300 too many racism workshops
Let it be entered into the Book of Stars
that I did not kill her or shoot a scathing reply from the hip
I let it pass because I could tell she was very interested in taking
up all the space with herself & would do it if I said a word
They all said something that I could turn into a poem
but I got tired & went to sleep behind my interested eyes
I've learned that the most important part of these tortures
is for them to speak about racism at all
Even showing up is heresy
because as we all know racism is some vague thing that really doesn't
exist or is only the skinheads on a bad day or isn't really a crucial problem
not as important certainly as queers being able to marry
or get insurance for each other
When they turned to me as resident expert on the subject
which quite honestly I can't for the life of me understand
or make any sense out of
I spoke from my feet
things I didn't know I knew
of our connections
of the deadly poison that racism is for all of us
Maybe some of them were touched
but my bitch voice jumps in to sayNOT MUCH!
I heard back that someone thought I was brilliant
Does that mean that I speak well
Or that she was changed
It's only her change
I need

ever do is die
Her brother was thrown out the window
by Black men he was drinking with
His cousin was stabbed near the store
She got shot
Nobody knows where he ended up
She hasn’t heard from her brother in 17 years
He killed himself when his wife left
Her son was hit by a car of drunk whites
Her uncle went off a cliff in the dark
Her grandmother died in the hospital
because they gave her the wrong medicine
Her baby was born addicted & died
My brother died as a baby
Her mother died of an overdose
She doesn’t know how her mother died

I can smell the sweet scent of my own sweat
as I blow high with the breeze and swing,
I pump my legs like a child again my skinny kid’s butt
holds me down, keeps me grounded
when adults threaten to pull me off.
My chain breaks as I tempt to kiss the sun,
my knees have a life of their own bending
as if my very existence depended on it,
and it does, for I’d rather be a nut flying high
over people’s heads than on the ground dying
touching the earth, staining the water
with my unclean mind, my hands washing red
off the money so I can sleep off my power trip
and back stabbing toys.
I was an old soul at five spouting off
about the filth of my generation.
I knew greed was the root of all evil,
competition in close cousin.
I had my doubts about civilization as I found it
and convinced my sister Tricia to wear
flannel jammies zipped to the throat in the summer
to protect us from the babysitter’s bloodsucking
husband while our parents went out for supper.

day and night
we took lessons:
piano, jazz, tap, ballet,
the dance team, trumpet,
trombone, tennis, Finishing School,
and one awful summer golf;
Christened, Confirmed, Cathechismized;
it all cut me in several places,
molding of head and heart
making me ultrasensitive,
then and now,
an observer of the outside,
an outsider among my own kind,
my very shade,
mysterious aloof
black haired beauty
who can't speak Spanish,
living among blue eyed dyed blond bombshells,
who held up her head higher
because she's shy not stuck-up,
understood, undenied, sacrificed to at any price
by my beloved little brown parents
who taught me well
gave up so much
so their daughters could shine
and they'd swell with pride
at the life they had given us,
on Sundays we basked
in mutual admiration after mass
singing our church songs while making breakfast,
according to the unspoken doctrine in our house of:
fast first eat later after communion,
we intruded with our Mexican music
bellowing out the open windows
the smell of bacon frying,
pancakes baking, coffee
and eggs scrambled to order
it wafted out on beautiful summer mornings
out of our house in Pleasant Hill, Iowa,
perched on the highest spot
one could reach on the East Side of the street

I’ve ballooned to a specific kind of ugly

After this winter of gluttony & grief
 
spring comes, stabbing her hard stem
of anger in the throat. Even garlic scapes
are flat balloons, their ugliness specific
 
as my penmanship: green tubes of spice
& hate. My body speaks the ugly testament
that took all winter. It says: Gluttony & grief balloon, darling. Only kindness is specific.

                ","
I still see those men haphazardly standing
around the comps’ floor, mostly silent,
lost in their latest urgent jobs,
looking up and down as if nodding yes
 
from what they call their composers’ sticks
as they set inverse words and lines
of each page that could be taken for
Greek scripture, declaring:
 
In the beginning was the Word and the Word
was made cold type and the Word was
coldness, darkness, shiny greyness
and light—and the Word dwelt amongst us.
 
                                      *
 
Oh, I know these men would laugh this off.
They’d say, if they simply didn’t throw
their eyes to heaven, that they were just ordinary
characters trying to keep the devil from the door,
 
and with luck have enough left over each week
to back a few nags, and go for a few jars.
But they can’t say anything or set anything now.
They are scattered from that place that’s not
 
the same any more and many have left
any place we know of in this life,
calling to mind the old names for printing:The Mysterious Craft or simply The Mystery.
 
                                          *
 
I set them up in another city, another country
that’s as far away in distance
from that city as it’s far in time.
But they are still composing,
 
cracking the odd joke above
their sticks and galleys on some floor
of some building that is eternally busy
inside me even when I’ve forgotten
 
that I’ve forgotten them; forgetting
the world behind the word—
every time I read the word world I wonder
is it a typo and should I delete the l.
 
                                          *
 
Now again I hanker to know the quality
of each letter: the weight, the texture, the smell,
the shiny new type, the ink-dark shades of old,
the different types of type, the various sizes
 
within the same font, the measures in ems,
picas,  points and units. I’d set the words up,
making something out of all this
that stays standing—all set as masterly
 
as the words those men set that reveal
something of the mystery behind
and within these letters and the wonder and
the darkness, but with the lightest touch.
 
                                          *
And the umpteen ways things can foul up
are beyond telling. Maybe the type is off,
or the typesetter may not be up
to the work, if only out of a hangover
 
setting an ! where there should be a ?
or a b where there should be a d,
or miss aspace or a line or dingbat.
And the proofreaders don't catch the error,
 
passing the copy on as clean, or the make-up man
fouls the assembly page, or the stoneman errs
as he fastens the page of cold type and furniture
with the chase, turning the quoin’s key.
 
                                          *
 
Not to speak of the evil eye cast by
fellow composers ready
to knock the words of others, or the bosses
writing on the composition: Kill.
 
Old Shades, keep my words from such eyes
and fretting about that pied world and let me go
on regardless. And even if I foul up and the stewards
are right to set Kill on my last page and my words
 
are distributed and thrown in the hellbox,
the real achievement will be that I tried to set
the words right; that I did it with much labor
and not without a font of love. But that said,
 
                                          *
 
grant me the skill to free the leaden words
from the words I set, undo their awkwardness,
the weight of each letter of each word
so that the words disappear, fall away
 
or are forgotten and what remains is the metal
of feeling and thought behind
and beyond the cast of words
dissolving in their own ink wash.
 
Within this solution we find ourselves,
meeting only here, through The Mystery,
but relieved nonetheless to meet, if only
behind the characters of one fly-boy’s words.

Your first dog is ever your one dog
And no story has a happy ending anymore.

Our own. Some nights are long ones, some
Never end at all. I don’t know how we canfall in love, which implies landing,
Whereas love promises everything but.

At dusk to each other from the acacias
But then I recall it’s still daylight and I
Hear them in the absence of the trees.

All I think of is the sea. My father was
Never quite so alive until he died and now

Somebody must work out the logic of the logic
Of this spectacle because spectacle’s the last
Word anyone would use for dreams that don’t cease,
For the sound of weeping coming from the next room,
Only there’s no next room and we’re the only ones
There, though just for a moment and a lifetime more.
Listen, I will tell you a secret, the secret you told
Me once on the train into the mountains
On the journey to the shore, a time long ago when
We spoke and never met. That secret, which is ours.

While others are impatient to die.” Don’t say
 
I did not warn you. Next time they swear
Shit happens, pop them square in the nose.
 
This will not help anybody, but helping is
The farthest thing from my imperial mind.
 
If you keep your spirit blameless and pure
People will drape you with laurels but
 
No one will have sex with you in backseats
Or marble mausoleums or anywhere else,
 
A small price to pay for honor and respect
Though not for me, being an emperor with no clothes.
 
Just pretend today is the last day of your life
And act accordingly—not that such strictures
 
Apply to Yours Truly, sports fans.
The forces of evil march on the fortress
 
Of your self. I wish I could explain why.
But what if evil did not exist and what if
 
Your self was no fortress, see what I mean?
Stoics get a bad name. Not in touch with feelings.
 Too rigid. Know-it-all cocksure mothers.
So the Stoics retain PR firms, don’t tell a soul.
 
If you really knew what was good for you,
And you do, why do you care I’ll flail you alive?
 
True, pissing off your emperor is a poor plan,
Even one like me mounted bare-assed on a steed.
 
Once upon a time, children…The story peters out.
Circus revels and gladiatorial raves—
 
Seen one, seem them all. Life is tiresome,
When will it end and will we ever notice?
 
I wish I knew. Really, I wish I cared.
My pal, Marcus Aurelius, natters day and night:
 
“Living is more like wrestling than dancing.”
Guess he never saw me take Molly at the club.
 
And he says we always have the option of
Having no opinion. Right. Like he knows.
 
OK, then, where did I put my pants?

We packed your satchel with sweatshirts,
Soccer equipment, and The Elements of Style,
Loaded up the Hum Vee, a sad drive to JFK
And the cross-country flight to starting college,
where fortunately due to Advanced Placement
Courses you’ve already been awarded your MFA
And published your first book.
As we pulled out of the driveway, I slammed
On the brakes, and not on account of Jubilation,
The neighbor’s cat. “Stacey,” I said, “we have jumped the gun.”
“I didn’t know we had a gun, Pops,” you said.
“This is a figure of speech, a melonaphore.
But you can’t go to college yet,
Stacey, you’re barely by my count five years old.”
“That’s all right, Daddy-O, nice try.

Love this puppy and your love will be repaid.
I can’t stress how little this will teach you about life.
Which it will. Which is a lot.
Sometimes, when you’re sad, I won’t know what to say.
Desire will cut into the bone.
So much we need to cover before you’re on your own.
This is a tea kettle, where goldfish won’t feel at home.
When I was your age, before you were born,
A war was almost certainly about to break out.
The Russians turned out to be just like us,
Only worse drivers, which is a lot like us, too.
I had a pet once, too, you know. An accordion.
Very tough to train, stained with fluids as it was
About which nothing further need be said.
Your questions matter. No, they really do.
I have no clue as to the white carnations,
No reason to suppose the stars were not meant for you.

Upon a time fish did not even catnap.
Childhood has reached a certain point.
More specific than that, I cannot be,
Or less. When you drive to Chartres
You can see it coming at you far away.
Never pass up a cathedral if you can.
Drink lots of water with the strawberries.
Leap before you look too hard, which makes
Things swim in your head, like fish that never sleep.

“And the bees?”

“Was just asking.”
“A falcon is one bird you can’t keep in a cage,
I can’t explain why, though I might point
To history for many instructive precedents.”
“You have trouble explaining, Dad.”
“Anyway, what I like about birds is, they’re much
Like dreams—they fly in through a window
Where you didn’t know there was a window before.”
“I get it. We open to the known and discover
Mysteries left in their place, like putting under the pillow
A tooth that fell out and you come up with the cash
When you need it in the morning, for school.”
“Let’s stay focussed, Amy.” “Sure, Reginald.”
“I mind it that you call me Reginald, who’s he?”
“Someday, Dad, I may fall in love.”
“Let’s go back to the birds. I don’t want to say
Love is for the ornithologists, though such thoughts occur.
Maybe the real topic is experience.”
“I knew that.” “When?” “You told me.” “I never.”
“Didn’t have to.” “That’s how, you just know?”
“Life’s a vale of tears, Pops, except when it’s not.”
“Hence, sweetheart, some birds thrive in cages.”
“Name three.” “I want you to try on some wings.
I want you to take flight. Like the day I gave birth…”
“What?” “The day I gave birth to you was the day of days.”
“You feeling OK?” “The epidural worked like a charm,
I felt like I was swimming in air.” “I think you’re confused.”
“I wouldn’t be the first, but when they handed you to me
You nursed till you fell asleep.” “You’re talking about love.”
“And some bees sting.”

Once we had a bond, a sacred trust.
I carried you on my shoulders, we watched
The finches dart and feed, I read The Odyssey 
To you, which OK was a stretch, but who cared
You did not exist? Certainly, not me.
But take the example of Homer.
Would you just give me a chance?
There’s an old dog called Argus
Who waits for the hero to show before he dies.
I’m getting to the point. If we never had a dog
I would wait for you to arrive from a journey
Forced upon you by chance and fate.
You see, the whole thing’s about waiting.
There you are off-stage readying yourself
For a grand entrance into a life none of us
Heretofore presumed. I myself ache
Barometrically in concert with the coming storms.
If you never are, I have something left over
Even if it’s only me, watching you wade in, as if
You were a great swimmer and this world another shore.

                ","
Prologue Willy Loman’s reckless daughter flies quietly,fluttering like a silk-moth behind me
 blocking my life, my scenesin whichever stage direction she wants.
 Sometimes at night I can feel her dialing into me,her ringing calls like an imperial decree.
 When she sleeps she crashes, like a carinto the guardrail of my ambition.
 Her curse like a poison I cannot smell,an asphyxiation of the self by the self, that hell and hard sell.
 Split personalities, we dream through the night,of our merger and acquisition, in her half-moon light,
 Not even my husband can feelher there between us—a secret contract under seal.
 When I awaken, her irises touch mine;an awful, indecipherable fault line.
 She’s a character in search of an author, a devotee,trying to recount her history through me,
 until I channel her. She’s like a phantom limb,hymn to the invisible. Her shameless whims,
 the subtext of my lies. Under her tinted hairthe forest murmurs, becomes a thought, or prayer.
 Until her thoughts tumble into mine;colors bleed. In the morning, I’m overwrought—
 My patrilineal kin, she begins to wear thin,when she undoes hospital corners I’ve tucked so gently in.
 Her cool white rising is meringue completing—the high-pitched silence of our congealing.
 She was always ceremonially unfoldinghis white shirts, unpressing the folds
 in my circumstance. I did and didn’t want her. I kepttrying to catch her, then let her slip. Any intent
 to have her near made her more invisible. Her electricbreasts overfilled my brassieres. An interaction, our dialectic—
 She never removes her hat upon entering the doorto my personality. Ma semblable, ma soeur!

As the father turns away from the thought
of his failure, the hands remove
his glasses and rub his eyes over
 
and over, drying the nonexistent tears.
Unknown to the one who is troubled
about losing his hair, his fingers stroke
 
his baldness as he speaks. The body,
our constant companion, understands
the loneliness of the hostess in her dark
 
driveway, embracing herself after the guests
who promised more and soon have gone,
and even visits the old schoolteacher
 
who reads the same happy ending to each
new class, working her toes in her shoes.
How could the people of the kingdom
 
not have known the curse of sorrow
was nothing more than a long sleep
they had only to wake from? In dreams
 
the body, which longs for transformation
too, suddenly lifts us above the dark
roofs of our houses, and far above

like any other small things fastened to earth.

the pond’s alive—
its beauty (the sudden
scintillation of a hundred
thousand wavelets)
 
and music (the percussion
of a beaver’s tail)
arising from what is.
And when the pond
 
accumulates
the darkness,

it challenges your eyes
 
to find the light
that without darkness
you could not see.

It must be difficult for God, listening
to our voices come up through his floor
of cloud to tell Him what’s been taken away:
Lord, I’ve lost my dog, my period, my hair,
all my money. What can He say, given
we’re so incomplete we can’t stop being
surprised by our condition, while He
is completeness itself? Or is God more
like us, made in His image—shaking His head
because He can’t be expected to keep track
of which voice goes with what name and address,
He being just one God. Either way, we seem
to be left here to discover our losses, everything
from car keys to larger items we can’t search
our pockets for, destined to face them
on our own. Even though the dentist gives us
music to listen to and the assistant looks down
with her lovely smile, it’s still our tooth
he yanks out, leaving a soft spot we ponder
with our tongue for days. Left to ourselves,
we always go over and over what’s missing—
tooth, dog, money, self-control, and even losses
as troubling as the absence the widower can’t stop
reaching for on the other side of his bed a year
later. Then one odd afternoon, watching something
as common as the way light from the window
lingers over a vase on the table, or how the leaves
on his backyard tree change colors all at once
in a quick wind, he begins to feel a lightness,
as if all his loss has led to finding just this.
Only God knows where the feeling came from,
or maybe God’s not some knower off on a cloud,
but there in the eye, which tears up now
at the strangest moments, over the smallest things.

of vessel, vial, capsule, hull, a tiniest nil
fires the neurons from their swooning stall,
is not a healing but adaptation to same
a quickening in deleting of sensation

are givens in the columned garden, what work is needed
to determine that shape? Some hysteric
trope of repetition, rage for accretion,
dazed by its own mute replication,
like the minute lines of a hand. They are
its cries (writes Ponge, among others),
the tongue inseparable from its utterance (langue).
We weep to hear it, a language forgot.

(Skellig Michael) does not belong to any world that you and I have lived and worked in: it is part of our dream world…then (heading back) we were pursued by terrors, ghost from Michael…

The ferry furrows
the foam,
leaving a wake
that quickly settles
and forgets us,
as it has forgotten
all those
who’ve opened these waters:
fisherman, monk, pilgrim and pagan,
some foundering here.
Our mainland
world diminishes.
There is respite.
A cloud engulfs us
out of nowhere
as if the miraculous
were about to appear.
The veil lifts
to reveal the small Skellig
and Skellig Michael
rising like chapel and cathedral.

We forget speech, hypnotized by the climb,
concentrating on narrow, rock-hewn steps
that spiral up like the gyres
of the Book of Kells, whirling in labyrinths
of knowledge, turmoil and eternity.
They lead to the beehive huts and oratories
packed with a congregation of sightseers
who whisper in disbelief and reverence
at how those sometime monks lived
in this wind-tugged cloister of shells.
 
We browse in each dome’s live absence
and picnic above the graveyard
that’s no bigger than a currach
with a crucifix for helmsman
navigating his crew to the island of the dead.
We’re eyed by the staunch, monkish puffins.
Our tongues loosen, but, in keeping
with the somberness of this sun-haloed place,
we chat about the world with an earnestness
that would embarrass us on the mainland.
 
You tell of medieval monks charting world maps
with countries drawn as humans gorging upon
each other’s entangled bodies. We go on to
the lands and demons of the world of poetry.
I’m flummoxed when you ask what poetry is.
I recall how the earliest musical instruments
were hewn out of bones, and that poets
carve their words out of those gone before.
They are the primitive musicians who beat
and blow words back to life. More than that I don’t know.

That dusk at Dún an Óir we slaughtered even
the pregnant, whimpering women methodically
while a bloodstained sun drowned in the ocean.
Each fetus struggled in the belly
of each slain mother as desperately
as a lobster dropped in a boiling pot.
Had shed blood been ink, I could still be
quilling The Faerie Queene, but I did not
allow a drop to blot a mere sonnet
that you, trapped in complicity, can never
quite break free of. Admit it, hypocrite!
In your time few are not guilty of slaughter.
Even the page you’ll pen this upon is of pine
that Amazonians were shot for. I could go on.
                                                                                   (Edmund Spenser)
I lifted the pitch of my grief
    above the storm-lashing waves
for my world breaking on the reefs
    of foreign, land-grabbing knaves,
 
who ignore dependence upon
    the lowliest plants and creatures
as the hermit crab and cloak anemone
    depend on one another.
 
But no matter what, you must
    keen for the world’s theft
as I keened mine, despite knowing
    soon no one may be left.
 
                                                                                   (Aodhagán Ó Rathaille)
Lend an ear to one of your own kind
   and do not let yourself be caught
by the winds of lust, like Dante’s starlings
   blown this way and that by every gust.
 
I myself was borne on this wind
   as I rode across country,
always wary that around the next bend
   my life would catch up with me.
My rakish ways squandered energy
   that I should have instilled in song,
more worthy of the muse-gift given to me
   than my odd aisling,
 
Pay particular heed to me, especially
   since your word-talent is less than mine.
I’m still too bushed to eke out a last line.

Sing up front,
cold-shouldering
the fashionable
low key of your time,
closed, cautious and crabbit
as a farmer.
 
Sing as open-throated
as my curlew keen.
I supped the red wine
of Art’s blood
as he lay slain,
already becoming Cork mud.
 
Sing as full-throated
as my unmatched plaint;
matching my words
to his cold body
that would never again
rouse to my touch.
My hands wept
that day’s icy rain
as I swore to undo
that kowtowing
dribble of a man
who slew my Art
of the winged white horse.
 
The spirit of that mare
I rode fleeter than any hare,
fleeter than any deer,
fleeter than the wind
through Munster’s open country.
 
Sing your provenance,
our elder province.
                                                                                     (Eibhlín Dubh Ní Chonaill)
I sang not for my own or for beauty's sake
as much as to keep our spirits fired, 
knowing as long as we sang we'd not break, 
refusing to allow the country be shired.
But it was too much when even our lands
turned hostile and drove us like lapwings
in the hard winter, together in dying bands,
our swollen bellies pregnant with nothing. 
Even the birds seemed to give up singing. 
So I lay down and relinquished song.
But I should have kept up my amhrán-ing, 
adapting and transmuting their tongue. 
Transform the spirit of where you belong, 
make something right out of what's wrong. 
                                                                                     (Tomás Rua Ó Súilleabháin)

still dreaming in the surf-rush 
    of Irish,

    of the sea.

[…]
The islands' standing army
of gannets fiercely snap,
stab and peck one another.
Few could match
the spite I unleashed 
on any who encroached 
into my territory. I spat 
with petrel accuracy. 
I should have had the wisdom 
of the sad-eyed puffins 
who let everyone come close,
sensing few mean hurt, 
though when forced to tussle
they'll show their worth. 
So learn from me. 
When I come to mind
don't recall how, feisty, 
I knocked nests of words
over the edge,
splattering on the rocks 
the crude squwaks of other 
ravaging, wing-elbowing birds; 
rather think of the winged poems 
I hatched, seen, 
regardless of time and place, 
gliding and gyring 
with their own grace.

tapping a pane while you're ensconced

Can you still hear a distant train whistle blow? 
Wet my whistle with a slug of Guinness.
What is the texture of fresh-fallen snow?
Do girls still wear their hair in braid?
What's tea? What's the smell of the sea?
Tell me. Tell me. I am beginning to fade.

The alarming, silhouetted bird
has a preternatural quality 
as it flutters about
my head, drawing me
from sleep's underworld. 
I resist its pull. 
Everything turns
into dream's usual montage. 
Another figure emerges 
but says nothing, 
as if that's what he came to say. 
His face merges into
one of a gagged female. 
She shimmers and vanishes. 
Dolphins break
beyond Blind Man's Cove,
returning the dead
to Bull Island, transmitting
their encrypted, underwater Morse. 
The savant local ferryman
informs us that Skellig Michael
was once a druidic site. 
His oil-wrinkled hands tug
the engine cord,
coaxing our boat
out of the cliff-shaded cove.
We withdraw
into the distance, 
leaving a disgruntling sense
that we've only touched the tip
of these dark icebergs.

I broke at last
the terror-fringed fascination
that bound my ancient gaze
to those crowding faces
of plunder and seized my
remnant life in a miracle
of decision between white-
collar hands and shook it
like a cheap watch in
my ear and threw it down
beside me on the earth floor
and rose to my feet. I
made of their shoulders
and heads bobbing up and down
a new ladder and leaned
it on their sweating flanks
and ascended till midair
my hands so new to harshness
could grapple the roughness of a prickly
day and quench the source
that fed turbulence to their

descent that day landing
backways into crouching shadows
into potsherds of broken trance. I
flung open long-disused windows

of sunlight become my home again
on whose trysting floor waited
my proud vibrant life.

openly washed involvement off his

talking of apostles that other fellow
Judas wasn’t such a fool

(for Niyi Osundare)



Something in altitude kindles power-thirst
Mere horse-height suffices the emir
Bestowing from rich folds of prodigious turban
Upon crawling peasants in the dust
Rare imperceptible nods enwrapped
In princely boredom.
 
I too have known
A parching of that primordial palate,
A quickening to manifest life
Of a long recessive appetite.
Though strapped and manacled
That day I commanded from the pinnacle
Of a three-tiered world a bridge befitting
The proud deranged deity I had become.
A magic rug of rushing clouds
Billowed and rubbed its white softness
Like practiced houri fingers on my sole
And through filters of its gauzy fabric
Revealed wonders of a metropolis
Magic-struck to fairyland proportions.
By different adjustments of vision
I caused the clouds to float
Over a stilled landscape, over towers
And masts and smoke-plumed chimneys;
Or turned the very earth, unleashed
From itself, a roaming fugitive
Beneath a constant sky. Then came
A sudden brightness over the world,
A rare winter’s smile it was, and printed
On my cloud carpet a black cross
Set in an orb of rainbows. To which
Splendid nativity came–who else would come
But gray unsporting Reason, faithless
Pedant offering a bald refractory annunciation?
But oh what beauty! What speed!
A chariot of night in panic flight
From Our Royal Proclamation of the rites
Of day! And riding out Our procession
Of fantasy We slaked an ancient
Vestigial greed shriveled by ages of dormancy
Till the eyes exhausted by glorious pageantries
Returned to rest on that puny
Legend of the life jacket stowed away
Of all places under my seat.
 
Now I think I know why gods
Are so partial to heights—to mountain
Tops and spires, to proud iroko trees
And thorn-guarded holy bombax,
Why petty household divinities
Will sooner perch on a rude board
Strung precariously from brittle rafters
Of a thatched roof than sit squarely
On safe earth.

My heart races
in the heave of the wind.
 
In the pivot of glass everything
is so small and manageable.
 
I think of an old song,
of purple cows in far fields,
 
I wonder what it’d take
to cover miles and miles

''At one time, I dreaded everything I was making.'

First it is just a measling of the tablecloth

in all colours, all gaiety:

smilingdelirious.
 
Twenty years
in a twelve square metre room
with the thuds of tennis balls
the only music
 
tells me
that suffering
is necessary
 
and more powerful
than healing
 
and I wish
to cover all territory
for once—hospital beds, chinaware,
bed linen, your bland skin
 
with the pattern and fear of all my dots—
by the old wharf on Naoshima
I make my yellow wartime pumpkins.
 
I know my home is not a country anymore,
just a festering colony of the mind:
 
these shuddering trees
that come and talk to me each night,
the whispers of the white nurses
and the star-dances
of my Japanese kaleidoscope.
Come haunt me still. Do what you may.

Finding myself in a mesmeric orientation,
before me appeared Benjamin Franklin,
who magnetized his French paramours
at dinner parties as an amusing diversion
from his most serious studies of electricity
and the ethereal fire. I like thinking about
how he would have stood on tiptoe to kiss
their buzzing lips and everyone would gasp
and clap for the blue spark between them.
I believe in an honest and forthright manner,
a democracy of plain speech, so I have to
find a way to explain I don’t care to have sex
anymore. Once I was a high school teacher
and there was a boy who everyday came in late,
who only came to school at all to sell drugs
out of his backpack, upon which he laid
his head like a pillow and closed his eyes
while I pointed at a chart diagramming
the anatomy of a sparrow. The vice principal
was watching and taking notes as I taught
this class, so I slid the bag from under
his cheek, as if not to wake him, wrapped
his fingers around a pen. I was trying
to be a gentle mother and also trying
to show I was in control of an unstable
situation. The boy, also trying to be
in control of himself, walked so slow
to my desk and we stood to watch him
push everything—binders, piles of ungraded
papers, a beaker of red pens to the floor.
He was so calm. How do you like it when I touch your things. I do not like it. I live
in a house with many blue mason jars,
each containing a feather collection or starfish
collection or vertebrae collection, and also
there is a fully articulated fetal alligator skeleton.
Each window is pressed by the design
of a sweet-gum branch, all the little orange
and red stars of its leaves, you can’t see
the perfect geometry this close, just haphazard
parabolas, but beneath the foundation
the roots mirror the branching. I have
a chart of this to pull down. The view is flat
and so quiet on the inside. Have I been
forthright yet? What I want to know is
what happens if I decide to never have sex
again? Or more precisely, can I decide
to not have sex again and still be kind?
And be a joy to others? I should mention
I am a wife. I should mention I was told
my sole purpose is to be joy to others.
The sidewalks outside are very full of people
and when I look at them I feel hopeless.
Benjamin Franklin was so jolly with his kite
and his key and his scandalous electricity.
He was so in love with women and drink
and democracy. Before I was this way,
I was not a house, I was just a jar and what
I wanted was to be broken. A cool trick
you can do that I once showed a class is crank
a wheel covered in felt against another felt
wheel. Static bristles and sparks and makes
your hair stand on end. But hook it to
a Leyden jar and the electricity fills up
in there, invisible as air. Becomes a glass
battery, until you too much the thing, then
wow! broken glass everywhere. I remember
wanting that. Do I have to always want that?
My house is blue and quiet. I can hardly
hear the squirrel in my sweet-gum tree
dancing like a sunbeam to sing his riddles:
“A house full, a hole full, but you cannot
gather a bowl full.” The air of everywhere
is wet with electric fluid, you can’t even tell,
but pop, whiz, everywhere. “In this
field,” Ben says, “the soul has room
enough to expand, to display all of her
extravagances.” The sweet gum has 10,000
sticky, spiky seed balls. They start green
but grow black and fall for want of
a barren season. They look like sea urchins.
I call them tree urchins and think it’s
a funny joke. I don’t tell it to anyone,
as I am tired of being told what is not.
Such a secret, I know, is an extravagance,
and I like best how it’s an extravagance so
small you must keep it in a jar with others
of its kind for it to ever mean anything at all.

My child is sitting cross-legged on the floor reading to herself.
Sometimes she is so full of need I push her to the floor.
Only once I did that and I don’t even remember the moment
right, but I was trying to wipe urine off my leg and she was
naughty like a squirrel and jumping and singing and her head
slammed into my chin, which hurt and even more than that,
it pissed me off, because she’s my beautiful child, but in that
button snap of a moment she was suddenly just one more person
and I pushed her away in a way that felt to me like setting her
down, but awkwardly, because of how she was also balancing
her feet on my feet as I tried to pour out a bowl of pee
from her little potty as a toothbrush dangled foaming
from my mouth. Somewhere in the mess of that morning
she’d become person enough to, in the space between us,
create force of momentum, and then I did not set her down,
but pushed her and she fell away from it against the wall
and was crying because I, her mommy, pushed her. And I know
this should be the poem about how I’m horrified at myself,
the poem about what in ourselves we have to live with,
but in that moment which followed two years of breastfeeding
and baby-wearing and sixty-nine hours of natural childbirth
and the hemorrhaging and the uncertain operation, after which
I pumped every two hours, careful not to let the cord tangle
in the IV. Even then when she cried and no matter what
and no matter and no matter and no matter and no matter what,
I held her all night if she cried so she would not ever know
someday you’ll cry alone, but I held her and ached and leaked
and bled too as long as it took. Of course there’ve been nights
since but sometimes it feels as if I’ve never been asleep again,
so when I say I pushed my two-year-old against a wall and I don’t
remember it happening that way but it happened and I did
and I’ve been wondering a long time now what the limit is
and when I would find the end of myself, and that day, which
was yesterday, was the end. And this day, when we played
hide-and-seek with Daddy, and touched bugs, and readFrog and Toad Are Friends twice together before she read it
to herself as I wrote this, this is the day that comes after.

Lightly used snow suits, size 2T, are $6 and snow boots are $3.
 
There is a little girl, maybe seven, fiddling with a tea set. Her mother
inspects drapes for stains.
 
Sometimes the very old and lonely are looking for an opening.
 
She glances up from her pricing and says something about the tea set
and a baby doll long ago.
 
I am careful not to make eye contact, but the mother with drapes has
such softness in her shoulders and her face and she knows how to say
the perfect kind thing—“What a wonderful mother you had.”
 
“Yes, she was.”
 
Why do children sometimes notice us and sometimes not?
 
From the bin of dolls: “What happened to your mother?”
 
“She died.”
 
The woman at the Salvation Army who sorts and prices is crying a little.
She seems surprised to be crying. “It’s been eighty years and I still miss
her.”
 
When my daughter was born I couldn’t stop thinking about how we
were going to die. If we were drowning, would it be better to hold her
to me even as she fought away or should I let her float off to wonder why
her mother didn’t help her? What if it’s fire and I have one bullet left? I
made sure my husband knew if there were death squads and he had to
choose, I’d never love him again if he didn’t choose her. If I’m lucky,
her crying face is the last thing I’ll see.
 
The mother with drapes is squeezing her daughter’s shoulder, trying to
send a silent message, but children are children. “Why did she die?”
 
“She was going to have a baby and—And she died.”
 
“But she was a wonderful mother.”
 
I’m holding a stack of four wooden jigsaw puzzles of farm animals,
dinosaurs, jungle animals, and pets. Each for a quarter.
 
“It’s silly how much I still miss her.” She takes out a tissue and wipes
her eyes and then her nose.

one hundred people came, including 5 of the 6 brothers and sisters. At

Susie said then to my grandmother, “Can you think of all the people
watching us in heaven now? And our mother must be in the front row.”
 
Grandma took her sister’s hand. “Our mother—Estelle.”
 
“Yes—her name was Estelle. I forgot that.”
 
They looked so happy then, saying her name back and forth to each
other. Estelle. Estelle.

Clouds filling windows were replaced by soot

We lost the smell of buttered beetroot, Wissotzky tea

For James Welch



The first harvest of wheat in flatlands
along the Milk startled me into thoughts of you
and this place we both remember and also forget as home.
Maybe it was the familiarity or maybe it was my own
need to ask if you have ever regretted leaving.
What bends, what gives?
And have you ever missed this wind?—it has now
grown warm with late summer, but soon
it will be as dangerous as the bobcat stalking calves
and pets just south of the river.
Men take out their dogs, a case of beer and wait
in their pickups for dawn, for a chance with their rifles.
They don’t understand that she isn’t going to make
any mistakes. With winter my need for an answer
grows more desperate and there are only four roads out.  
One is the same cat hunters drive with mannish glory
and return along, gun still oil-shined and unshot.
Another goes deeper into Assiniboine territory:
This is the one I should talk myself into taking next.
I haven’t much traveled the third except to visit
a hospital where, after the first time,
my mother had refused chemotherapy.
And the last road you know as well as I do—
past the coral-painted Catholic church, its doors
long ago sealed shut to the mouth of Mission Canyon,
then south just a ways, to where the Rockies cut open 
and forgive. There you and I are on the ascent.
After that, the arrival is what matters most.

                    When Black Men Drown Their Daughters
                ","
When black, men drown. They spend their whole lifetimes
justifying the gall of springing the trap, the inconvenience
of slouched denim, of coupling beyond romance or aim.
All the while, the rising murk edges toward their chins.
Hurriedly, someone crafts another scientific tome, a giddy
exploration of the curious dysfunction identifying black
men first as possible, then as necessary. Elegant equations
succumb to a river that blurs quotient and theory, rendering
them unreadable, and the overwhelm easily disappears
the men, their wiry heads glistening, then gulped. All that’s
left is the fathers’ last wisdom, soaked wreckage on silver:Girl, that water ain’t nothing but wet. I’m gon’ be alright.
 
When black men drown, their daughters turn to their mothers
and ask What should I do with this misnamed shiver in myleft shoulder? How should I dress in public? They are weary
of standing at the shore, hands shading their eyes, trying
to make out their own fathers among the thousands bobbing
in the current. The mothers mumble and point to any flailing
that seems familiar. Mostly, they’re wrong. Buoyed by church
moans and comfort food of meat and cream, the daughters
try on other names that sound oddly broken when pressed
against the dank syllables of the fathers’. Drained, with justforward in mind, they walk using the hip of only one parent.
They scratch in their sleep. Black water wells up in the wound.
 
When black men drown, their daughters are fascinated with
the politics of water, how gorgeously a surface breaks
to receive, how it weeps so sanely shut. And the thrashing
of hands, shrieking of names: I was Otis, I was Willie Earl,they called me Catfish. Obsessed by the waltzing of tides,
the daughters remember their fathers—the scorch of beard
electrifying the once-in-a-while kiss, the welts in thick arms,
eyes wearied with so many of the same days wedged behind
them. When black men drown, their daughters memorize all
the steps involved in the deluge. They know how long it takes
for a weakened man to dissolve. A muted light, in the shape
of a little girl, used to be enough to light a daddy’s way home.
 
When black men drown, their daughters drag the water’s floor
with rotting nets, pull in whatever still breathes. They insist their
still-dripping daddies sit down for cups of insanely sweetened
tea, sniffs of rotgut, tangled dinners based on improbable swine.
The girls hope to reacquaint their drowned fathers with the concept
of body, but outlines slosh in drift and retreat. The men can’t get
dry. Parched, they scrub flooded hollows and weep for water
to give them name and measure as mere blood once did. Knocking
over those spindly-legged dinette chairs, they interrupt the failed
feast and mutter Baby girl, gotta go, baby gotta go, their eyes
misted with their own murders. Grabbing their girls, they spit
out love in reverse and stumble toward the banks of some river.
 
When black men drown their daughters, the rash act is the only
plausible response to the brain’s tenacious mouth and its dare: Yes, yes, open your ashed hands and release that wingless child. Note
the arc of the sun-drenched nosedive, the first syllable of the child’s
name unwilling from the man’s mouth, the melody of billow that
begins as blessed clutch. Someone crouching inside the father waits
impatiently for the shutting, the lethargic envelop, and wonders if
the daughter’s wide and realizing eye will ever close to loose him.
It never will, and the man and his child and the daughter and her
father gaze calmly into the wrecked science of each other’s lives.
The sun struggles to spit a perfect gold upon the quieting splash.
The river pulses stylish circles of its filth around the swallow.

she’d be standing soaked

that keep chewing up the world.

to have slow-cooked to a slow song
in her sleek, toffee arms: her body
balanced between the Temptations’ 
five voices and me—a boy anointed

I remember that first time:
the empty auditorium, her voice,
the dark all around us,
her mouth reaching into mine.
She was Freddy’s foxy older sister,
and I didn’t know why
she wanted to kiss me. She
had already finished high school
and probably shouldn’t have
been walking the halls, but
she always called me her friend.
So one Monday after gym,
 
I found myself beside myself
in front of her house—with my
trench coat and lunch bag—
probably not looking much
like Shaft. Inside, the air held
warm milk and we talked a bit
about her baby    and her Aunt
who paid the rent painting cars.
 
Maybe she liked me because
we were both black and mostly
alone in the suburbs, but I hadn’t
thought about that. It was her voice
that got me—banked fire, the color
of dusk—her voice, and my name
was smoke in her mouth.
 
I think about it more than I should now,
that January noon—an hour before
algebra—how most days I’d be
thinking football    or replaying
the seventy-some kisses I’d gotten
over those lean years, but that day
 
Donna and me were on the couch
munching potato chips. Rrruffles have rrridges, she kidded coming
from checking the baby who’d
slipped into a nap. I was kind of
disappointed that we hadn’t
done anything, but I needed time
to get back to school, so I started
to stand. She said wait, look at this mess,
 
and with her left hand, she
brushed the crumbs from my lap
the way you’d whisk away lint—
then, swept over my pants again—
to be thorough, I guessed, but slower
and then some more, as if her hand
 
were getting    drowsy. You know
how sometimes you see something
but just can’t believe it—like a squirrel
bobbling a biscuit on your kitchen counter
or a cricket creeping the red feathers
of your mother’s Sunday hat?
 
Her hand there, on my lap,
could easily have been a five-fingered
flying saucer from the fifth dimension.
For awhile, I just watched and
wondered if she knew where
her hand had landed    but it was me
who didn’t know: me with my
six dozen kisses and the great Eden
of my virginity. How
do we not talk about it
 
every day: the ways
we were changed
by the gift
in someone’s touch—your body,
suddenly a bright instrument
played by an otherwise
silent divinity.
 
When I heard my zipper, I couldn’t
have said where my arms
were    or what a clock was for:
I had
no idea    I could be such a stranger
and still be myself. How could I
have known what a girl
 
might do to a boy
with her mouth     if she felt
like doing what her mouth
could do? It was

The unsympathetic wind, how she has evaded me for years now,
leaving a guileless shell and no way to navigate. Once when I stood
on a plateau of earth just at the moment before the dangerous,
jutting peaks converged upon the lilting sway of grasslands, I almost
found a way back. There, the sky, quite possibly all the elements,
caused the rock and soil and vegetation to congregate. Their prayer
was not new and so faint I could hardly discern. Simple remembrances,
like a tiny, syncopated chorus calling everyone home: across
a thousand eastward miles, and what little wind was left at my back.
But I could not move. And then the music was gone.
All that was left were the spring time faces of mountains, gazing down,
their last patches of snow, luminous. I dreamed of becoming snow melt,

                    The Talking Day
                ","
Some lunatic with a gun killed some people at an
immigration center in Binghamton, New York. Liz
Rosenberg and her family live up there and David, her
husband, teaches in the middle school which is close to
all the action (the way, in any smallish town, everything is
close to all the action). I called Liz to see if everyone was
all right and she was in her car driving to the elementary
school to pick up Lily, her young daughter she brought
back from China a few years ago. Lily was fine, but
Liz wanted to move her outside the question of how to
make sense of the broken pieces of “someone” with a
gun walking into a public space and then firing. There’s
something called (I learned from a news report the day of
the shootings at Virginia Tech) The Talking Day which
refers to the day immediately following the day when
something wildly violent happens. No one quite grasps
the reality of the situation and everyone spends that first day
talking about what happened and reliving it as language—
not so much to understand the violence but to make a
kind of recording of it: talking about it, letting go of it,
putting it down. And so I imagine it must be with Liz and
Lily and David in Binghamton, New York today: letting
“something” go. Liz is in her car after having just picked up
Lily at school and driving back home through a town that
suddenly makes no sense and she is telling the story about
what happened when a young man walked into a building
with a gun. And for Lily, who’s had a pretty serene, un-
violent United States time so far and whose endless joy
has made her an adorable chatterbox, tomorrow could be
her first talking day. Or, if not tomorrow, some other day.
We live in a talking day world.

The radio clicks on—it’s poor swollen America,
Up already and busy selling the exhausting obligation
Of happiness while intermittently debating whether or not
A man who kills fifty people in five minutes
With an automatic weapon he has bought for the purpose
Is mentally ill. Or a terrorist. Or if terrorists
Are mentally ill. Because if killing large numbers of people
With sophisticated weapons is a sign of sickness—
You might want to begin with fire, our early ancestors
Drawn to the warmth of it—from lightning,
Must have been, the great booming flashes of it
From the sky, the tree shriveled and sizzling,
Must have been, an awful power, the odor
Of ozone a god’s breath; or grass fires,
The wind whipping them, the animals stampeding,
Furious, driving hard on their haunches from the terror
Of it, so that to fashion some campfire of burning wood,
Old logs, must have felt like feeding on the crumbs
Of the god’s power and they would tell the story
Of Prometheus the thief, and the eagle that feasted
On his liver, told it around a campfire, must have been,
And then—centuries, millennia—some tribe
Of meticulous gatherers, some medicine woman,
Or craftsman of metal discovered some sands that,
Tossed into the fire, burned blue or flared green,
So simple the children could do it, must have been,
Or some soft stone rubbed to a powder that tossed
Into the fire gave off a white phosphorescent glow.
The word for chemistry from a Greek—some say Arabic—
Stem associated with metal work. But it was in China
Two thousand years ago that fireworks were invented—
Fire and mineral in a confined space to produce power—
They knew already about the power of fire and water
And the power of steam: 100 BC, Julius Caesar’s day.
In Alexandria, a Greek mathematician produced
A steam-powered turbine engine. Contain, explode.
“The earliest depiction of a gunpowder weapon
Is the illustration of a fire-lance on a mid-12th-century
Silk banner from Dunhuang.” Silk and the silk road.
First Arab guns in the early fourteenth century. The English
Used cannons and a siege gun at Calais in 1346.
Cerigna, 1503: the first battle won by the power of rifles
When Spanish “arquebusiers” cut down Swiss pikemen
And French cavalry in a battle in southern Italy.

Farm boys recruited to the armies of their feudal overlords.)

By salvage pirates off the Haitian reef where it had sunk.
And Cortes took Mexico with 600 men, 17 horses, 12 cannons.
And LaSalle, 1679, constructed a seven-cannon barque,
Le Griffon, and fired his cannons upon first entering the
     continent’s
Interior. The sky darkened by the terror of the birds.
In the dream time, they are still rising, swarming,
Darkening the sky, the chorus of their cries sharpening
As the echo of that first astounding explosion shimmers
On the waters, the crew blinking at the wind of their wings.

About 110,000. Contain, explode. They were throwing
Sand into the fire, a blue flare, an incandescent green.
The Maxim machine gun, 1914, 400-600 small caliber rounds

They could send things whistling into the air by boiling water.
The children around the fire must have shrieked with delight
1920: Iraq, the peoples of that place were “restive,”
Under British rule and the young Winston Churchill
Invented the new policy of “aerial policing,” which amounted,
Sources say, to bombing civilians and then pacifying them
With ground troops. Which led to the tactic of terrorizing
     civilian
Populations in World War II. Total casualties in that war,
Worldwide: soldiers, 21 million; civilians, 27 million.
They were throwing sand into the fire. The ancestor who stole
Lightning from the sky had his guts eaten by an eagle.
Spread-eagled on a rock, the great bird feasting.
They are wondering if he is a terrorist or mentally ill.
London, Dresden. Berlin. Hiroshima, Nagasaki.
The casualties difficult to estimate. Hiroshima:
66,000 dead, 70,000 injured. In a minute. Nagasaki:
39,000 dead, 25,000 injured. There were more people killed,
100,000, in more terrifying fashion in the firebombing
Of Tokyo. Two arms races after the ashes settled.
The other industrial countries couldn’t get there
Fast enough. Contain, burn. One scramble was
For the rocket that delivers the explosion that burns humans
By the tens of thousands and poisons the earth in the process.
They were wondering if the terrorist was crazy. If he was
A terrorist, maybe he was just unhappy. The other
Challenge afterwards was how to construct machine guns
A man or a boy could carry: lightweight, compact, easy to
     assemble.
First a Russian sergeant, a Kalashnikov, clever with guns
Built one on a German model. Now the heavy machine gun.
The weapon of European imperialism through which
A few men trained in gunnery could slaughter native armies
In Africa and India and the mountains of Afghanistan,
Became “a portable weapon a child can operate.”
The equalizer. So the undergunned Vietnamese insurgents
Fought off the greatest army in the world. So the Afghans
Fought off the Soviet army using Kalashnikovs the CIA
Provided to them. They were throwing powders in the fire
And dancing. Children’s armies in Africa toting AK-47s
That fire thirty rounds a minute. A round is a bullet.
An estimated 500 million firearms on the earth.
100 million of them are Kalashnikov-style semi-automatics.
They were dancing in Orlando, in a club. Spring night.
Gay Pride. The relation of the total casualties to the history
Of the weapon that sent exploded metal into their bodies—
30 rounds a minute, or 40, is a beautifully made instrument,
And in America you can buy it anywhere—and into the history
Of the shaming culture that produced the idea of Gay Pride—
They were mostly young men, they were dancing in a club,
A spring night. The radio clicks on. Green fire. Blue fire.
The immense flocks of terrified birds still rising
In wave after wave above the waters in the dream time.
Crying out sharply. As the French ship breasted the vast
     interior
Of the new land. America. A radio clicks on. The Arabs,
A commentator is saying, require a heavy hand. Dancing.

Watts bleeds
leaving stained reminders
on dusty sidewalks.
 
Here where I strut alone
as glass lies broken by my feet
and a blanket of darkness is slung
across the wooden shacks
of nuetsra colonia.
 
Watts bleeds
dripping from carcasses of dreams:
Where despair
is old people
sitting on torn patio sofas
with empty eyes
and children running down alleys
with big sticks.
 
Watts bleeds
on vacant lots
and burned-out buildings–
temples desolated by a people’s rage.
 
Where fear is a deep river.
Where hate is an overgrown weed.
 
Watts bleeds
even as we laugh,
recall good times,
drink and welcome daylight
through the broken windshield
of an old Impala.
 
Here is the Watts of my youth,
where teachers threw me
from classroom to classroom,
not knowing where I could fit in.
 
Where I learned to fight or run,
where I zigzagged down alleys,
jumped over fences,
and raced by graffiti on crumbling
factory walls.
 
Where we played
between boxcars,
bleeding from
broken limbs and torn flesh,
and where years later
we shot up carga 
in the playground
of our childhood.
 
Watts bleeds
as the shadow of the damned
engulfs all the chinga of our lives.
 
In the warmth of a summer night,
gunshots echo their deadly song
through the silence of fear;
prelude to a heartbeat.
 
Watts bleeds
as I bled
getting laid-off from work,
standing by my baby’s crib,
touching his soft check
and fingering his small hand
as dreams shatter again,
dreams of fathers
for little men.
 
Watts bleeds
and the city hemorrhages,
unable to stop the flow
from this swollen and festering sore.
 
Oh bloom, you trampled flower!
Come alive as once

All night vigil.
My two-and-a-half-year-old boy
and his 10-month-old sister
lay on the same bed,
facing opposite ends;
their feet touching.
They looked soft, peaceful,
bundled there in strands of blankets.
I brushed away roaches that meandered
across their faces,
but not even that could wake them.
Outside, the dark cover of night tore
as daybreak bloomed like a rose
on a stem of thorns.
I sat down on the backsteps,
gazing across the yellowed yard.
A 1954 Chevy Bel-Air stared back.
It was my favorite possession.
I hated it just then.
It didn’t start when I tried to get it going
earlier that night. It had a bad solenoid.
I held a 12-gauge shotgun across my lap.
I expected trouble from the Paragons gang
of the west Lynwood barrio.
Somebody said I dove the car
that dudes from Colonia Watts used
to shoot up the Paragons’ neighborhood.
But I got more than trouble that night.
My wife had left around 10 p.m.
to take a friend of mine home.
She didn’t come back.
I wanted to kill somebody.
At moments, it had nothing to do
with the Paragons.
It had to do with a woman I loved.
But who to kill? Not her–
sweet allure wrapped in a black skirt.
I’d kill myself first.
Kill me first?
But she was the one who quit!
Kill her? No, think man! I was hurt, angry. . .
but to kill her? To kill a Paragon?
To kill anybody?
I went into the house
and put the gun away.
 
Later that morning, my wife came for her things:
some clothes, the babies. . . their toys.
A radio, broken TV, and some dishes remained.
I didn’t stop her.
There was nothing to say that my face
didn’t explain already.
Nothing to do. . . but run.
 
So I drove the long haul to Downey
and parked near an enclosed area
alongside the Los Angeles River.
I got out of the car,
climbed over the fence
and stumbled down the slopes.
A small line of water rippled in the middle.
On rainy days this place flooded and flowed,
but most of the time it was dry
with dumped garbage and dismembered furniture.
Since a child, the river and its veins of canals
were places for me to think. Places to heal.
Once on the river’s bed, I began to cleanse.
I ran.
 
I ran into the mist of morning,
carrying the heat of emotion
through the sun’s rays;
I ran past the factories
that lay smack in the middle
of somebody’s backyard.
I ran past alleys with overturned trashcans
and mounds of tires.
Debris lay underfoot. Overgrown weeds
scraped my legs as I streamed past;
recalling the song of bullets
that whirred in the wind.
 
I ran across bridges, beneath overhead passes,
and then back alongside the infested walls
of the concrete river;
splashing rainwater as I threaded,
my heels colliding against the pavement.
So much energy propelled my legs
and, just like the river,
it went on for miles.
 
When all was gone,
the concrete river
was always there
and me, always running.

                    Heavy Tells A Story
                ","
When Heavy tells a story
the millwright shanty under the electric furnaces
chokes with quiet, amid the roar,
as Heavy pauses, adjusts his mountainous weight
over a creaky grease-stained metal chair
and looks up at the whirling ceiling fan
next to fluorescent lights hanging by wires.
His fingers lace like so many sausages
across the canvas of blue workshirt
on his chest.
 
Heavy tells his story
and the voice of reason quickens the demise
of foulness from red-faced millwrights
just back from a repair job
and sitting around for the five air whistles
that again call them to combat on the furnace floor.
 
All laughter stops, all nonsense sayings
and cuts of wisdom cease their echo
when Heavy tells a story.
 
Heavy talks about the Mexican melter
who once had an affair with the Pit Boss’s wife.
The heart of the problem–and the fact
from which the story’s plot revolves–
was that the melter lived across the street
from the Pit Boss.
One night just before the graveyard shift,
the melter left his home, kissed his wife’s
round face and proceeded to walk to the bus stop.
But a bullet pierced through his hardhat
and he fell, like an overturned stack of fire bricks,
onto the pavement.
The moral of this story:
Never have an affair with someone
whose old man lives
within shooting distance.
 
Heavy tells a story
about a furnace foreman who always yelled
at the laborers for failing to clean
the bag house of the built-up filth
from hours of cooking scrap iron and ore.
The men told him it was too dangerous
to walk on the tin-roofed panels;
their weight could cause
them to fall some 30 feet
into the gaping mouth of a flaming furnace below.
“Nonsense,” the foreman yelled,
“you’re all just lazy Polacks.”
(he called everyone Polacks).
The foreman then proceeded to walk
across the roof as the men stood nearby,
with mouths open, near the safety of side beams.
“You see,” he said standing in the middle
as hydraulics moved shutters
up and down to capture the sulphur dust.
 
Then the foreman moved forward
and before anyone could shout,
he crashed through the roof,
screaming into a reddened pot of molten metal;
the oxygen in his body making popping sounds
as it entered. The furnace operates continued
to pour ladles of scrap iron and to melt the steel.
They skimmed the slag off the top
and when it was ready, they poured
the molten mass into ingot molds.
There was nothing they could do for the foreman,
they said. Production had to keep going.
 
Heavy looks into the eyes of his listeners and says:
Somewhere there’s a skyscraper in downtown LA
with steel beams made from the ingot
with the foreman’s body in it.
Somewhere there’s a bridge or underground pipe
with the man’s remains chemically bound
within the molecular structure.
 
Heavy tells a story. . .
 
and the men lay down their tools,
and coffee is poured into heavy ceramic cups,
the shanty stills beneath the rumbling,
and even foremen stop by
to pay a listen
when Heavy tells a story.

Continue to pour my thoughts out on this topic of discussion
Slow down, I keep gettin the feeling that I’m rushin
Like my cousin’s dying breaths, or the decision that was made
But lemme backtrack, letting feelings get in the way

Goals that were attainable, wanted to be the flyest
We all searchin for something we’ve made a pact to do
The drive of ambition, it’s in us, it’s in you
Now snatch every dream that a mother had for her son
And replace that with a breath, “Baby, just take another one!”
A white man’s gun, the very courier of evil
He left, enjoyed his night, but the gunshots were lethal
Deceitful, everything we’ve been told from the start
We’ve more than just some ghetto thugs, these thoughts split us
    apart
What you must understand is our culture bore from oppression
The Hip Hop inside of us a form of expression
I wish I had the chance to explain to Jordan’s killer
That the song “Beef” by Lil Reese shouldn’t label him a dealer
Or is he ignorant or another ghetto thug?
Do you understand that your ignorance filled him with 3 slugs?

I want this country to head in the right direction
Instead of discussin who the Grammys should be awardin

talk of years past, of people they knew
 
       and Leonard, is he still in prison? 
       yeah, he’s still doing time      well, that’s good, I guess, means he’s still alive

and they laugh between the ironylife, huh, she tells him, it’s crazy, the things we get into, 
he agrees
the rest of us caught silently in their exchange agree, as well
 
his arms are thick with hair
and tattoos of skills
and scrawled out
indecipherable letters of the alphabet
 
      yeah, this chick that was riding with me once, he tells her
    got her jacket belt caught on my wheel   I didn’t even know it until I got to the next light
   I went back, she was alright, just fell off, didn’t get hurt or nothing  she was pissed though. 
 
“just fell off, didn’t get hurt,” what does he mean?
this story just drops off, I want to know a little more, a lot more
I mean, how fast was the bike going when she fell off
did she ruin the belt, scrape her nose
did they drink a lot of beer afterwards?
 
and so the time drags by, the line lengthens
now and then people unbury their heads
from their midmorning dragging into noon thoughts
women adjust their bra straps
scold their kids with unfulfilled warnings
the folks behind the counter look at us
holding their half empty cups of coffee

After a bad night I lock myself in my room and read
I had only imagination
I remember how on our wedding day    he said
I shall never let trouble or nervousness concern you    you can trust me
I must not forgive    I cannot    
I know the real truth now
My imagination tinges everything with ill adventure
I suppose a cry clears the air    as other rain does
 
• 
I have a good memory for details
it is not always so with young ladies    or so it had been said to me
I cannot comprehend this husband
Women all their lives are interrupted    considered hysterical
summoned to make children for the strong and manly
and for his sake must smile and not speak
Now this man I began to think a weak fool
I had trusted him    my husband
even half believed his words when he said
I would have an ordinary life    without dread
 
• 
Let me tell you from experience of men
his brain and heart are terrible things
This man    impotent in the dark
He succeeded in getting me to doubt
everything took a hue of unreality
I did not trust even my own senses
You don’t know what it is to doubt everything    even yourself
I am a wife he fashioned by his own hand
to be sweet and earnest and so kind
 
• 
An idea struck me
Following great loss     people see things that others cannot
Men want to explain explain explain
see themselves new    pretend to be young
Ladies’ bodies are deemed unholy
by the very men who burn them
Generations of men believe that women
walk amongst them without knowledge
My thesis is this
I want to believe    to believe    
to believe in
a universe    willing
to understand

In the desert, the moonshivers. Tonight, to stay awake, I’ll cut my feet

“I hate your Indian face.”In the dream I’m running. My limbs skeletal
and scabbed.After my mother’s death, I found, in a box,
her wedding dress.As I lifted the lid, a stench corkscrewed
into my nostrils:the dress had curdled like milk. During the day
I gather tinder.Paper. Shed snakeskin. When the last light
above the mountainsknots into stars, I crouch under mesquite,make a fire.Sometimes the moon stops shivering. Sometimes
I tally what I owe.In the dream I’m running through a hallway.
The floor uneven.The walls green. Last month, as my son blew out
the candleson his cake, I noticed, for the first time,
the hideous shapeof his nose. Tonight I’ll pinch my thighs to stay
awake. My mother,in the clinic, said, “The rain has a fever, it
needs plentyof rest, it needs to drink plenty of water.” The doctor
scribbled in a filethen asked for more money. If my mother
could see me now!My feet bloody. My face darker than ever.

What you need will come to you at the right time says the tarot card I overturned at my friend Nathalie’s house one evening. I was wondering if she said something worth hearing, What? I’m looking at her face, trying to read it, not a clue what she said but I’ll just say yeah and hope. Me, Tabitha, and her aunt are waffling in Waffle House by the Mississippi River. Tabitha’s aunt is all mumble. She either said Do you want a pancake? or You look melancholic. The less I hear the bigger the swamp, so I smile and nod while my head becomes a faint foghorn, a lost river. Why wasn’t I asking her to microphone? When you tell someone you read lips you become a mysterious captain. You watch their brains navigate channels with BSL interpreters in the  corner of night TV. Sometimes it’s hard to get back the smooth sailing and you go down with the whole conversation. I’m a haze of broken jars, a purple bucket and only I know there’s a hole in it. On Twitter @justnoxy tweets I can’t watch TV / movies / without subtitles. It’s just too hard to follow. I’m just sitting there pretending and it’s just not worth it. I tweet back you not being able to follow is not your failure. It’s weird, giving the advice you need to someone else, weird as thinking my American friend said I move through London like a Hotep when she actually said I’m used to London life with no sales tax. Deanna (my friend who owns crystals and mentions the existence of multiple moons) says I should write about my mishearings, she thinks it’ll make a good book for her bathroom. I am still afraid I have grown up missing too much information. I think about that episode of The Twilight Zone where an old man walks around the city bar selling bric-a-brac from his suitcase, knowing what people need — scissors, a leaky pen, a bus ticket, combs. In the scene, music is playing loud, meaning if I were in that bar I would miss the mysticism while the old man’s miracles make the barman say WOAH, this guy is from another planet!

The Sangre de Cristo Mountains mottled as if with oil stains. Configurations of cloud-shadows.
Easy gait of hours: a way through — or into — the dry winds.Our church is the mountains, says the guide to the tour group, all of whom have been instructed to keep their cameras inside their bags.  A group crowding the aisles of San Geronimo Chapel.
On the dirt path between adobe structures, bareheaded. Stretching, palms out, as steam from the boiling pot does.
To move along the earth without keeping a ledger.
The horsefly not so incongruous with the sagebrush. Still, reflexive swatting.We’re good citizens, we serve in the Army, though we’re regarded as second  class by the US government.
Framed badges and news stories in the house of the retired sheriff. Men in his family who have been policemen, firemen, soldiers. His wife pinching the ears of bear sculptures formed from mica clay.
Thick paste of red soil and the piñon that pierces through it.
To carry on from day to day without exercising the sloppy hand of  manipulation.
Four dollars for a plate of fry bread in cinnamon butter. The boy at the counter restless, wanting to get back to the electronic dance  music on pause on his iPhone.
Reading a history backward, the deep strata.
Settling on this life as a parasite on its host.That man next door who you bought from? He sells jewelry made by an Anglo woman. His wife.
The stray dog asleep on her side, dreams ripped from her open jaw.
Money touched from hand to hand.
Whole lifetimes spent trying to make sense of an appetite.
A town called Tres Orejas. Three ears. Plenty.

It is terrifying to wake up

His mother is growing him
with the milk she makes all day,
spilling out in blue.

puts him to sleep,

The Ware Collection of Blaschka Glass Models of Plants,  Harvard Museum of Natural History



The ovaries, when splayed, resemblesliced tomatoes. Or rose windows,
each geometry precise enoughto praise. I want to press my tongue
against the bloodroot petal, to runits stamen along my slick shelf of
teeth like a man might with a wheat stalk.Four times so far other tourists
have taken me for a galleryattendant. In the glass, a slow-
sidling crimson spreads over my ownskewed reflection: a hesitant
teen in a Harvard hoodie, the fifth,leans in to ask, Excuse me, sir?Are they really glass? — a testamentto how my binder encases
my breasts, my faith in the plum yew’s fruit-shorn frenzy. Dense clusters teeming
with their separate blossoms, anyunknowing eye might think they were
living. But I know the lilac’s tell:two blemishes, bulbous where some
hot glass mis-dripped, then caught foreverin the filament. Sometimes, I think
I’ll wake to find they’ve finallytrickled off me in the night, pooled
molten down the bed and gatheredback again. I might thrash off both breasts
in a sleepless fit, or could unfurlmy clit like a pollen basket passed
from a honeybee’s hind legsto the hive. It makes its secret
seen. I can only answer yes. Yes,They’re real. I mean, they’re really glass.
You could snap a stem between fingerswith such a slight force, one stark blink — 
the flies flitting the gallery would fearthe weight of their own landing,
thick wings rapt still. When the public,in their distressed astonishment,
demanded to know how the Blaschkastransported the models without
a fracture in even one pistil,Leopold Blaschka revealed his own
elaborate process: pack eachflower tightly in its cardboard
cradle, then strap them down with strong wireto restrict movement, and set each, at last,
in a wooden box wrapped with burlap.They drove them straight from Manhattan
in two hearses. The drivers, of course,wore black suits. Onlookers parted
to allow their small procession past.I like it here, with everyone
focused on the flowers. Hunched, kneeling,as if suspicious, still doubting,
the teen eyes two tiny zinnias,then moves on to another case.
I’ve seen many leave unsatisfied.They can’t bear to be partitioned — 
how can I blame them? Someone made thesewith their body. They let their breath
unspool to form each impossiblebud, crafted every flower’s fold,
then waited on the heat to break tohold just one, wearing special gloves.
Wouldn’t anyone wish for just one lieamong a garden this precise?
One daisy swapped out in secret, switchedwith a common courtyard flower,
now waiting for someone to noticeits wilt while its counterparts keep
all their glisten. It does seem to metrue punishment: never to change.
Unflinching forever. Sometimes, nearclosing, when the hall becomes quiet,
I really do believe they’re real.

There I was, all spread out for the taking,
bloomed wings waiting for winter
sleet. It was a long season of drinking whole
creeks and nothing else. We churned desert
into desert. What I’m saying is, neither the desert
rat nor damselfly can bear the nosebleeds: shoal-
laced face bearing down just in time to overwinter.
There I was, all spread out for the taking.
In truth, nobody wants water this thin.
One swallow, and we’re off to dig for more within
a hollow womb. This morning we sip water,
discussing the trauma in our blood: saltwater — 
there it rests, in droplets, on my breast skin,
“Oh,” I say. “My tears,” rubbing them deep within.xi
At church I sat salvaged: I said to send me
away wearing nothing but satin and lace.
We both felt secondhand. It was knee-
length, and it wore me cheap. I couldn’t embrace
the old woman who once wore it, couldn’t see
my wrists even. And my neck, it was braced
up all in lace. The woman next to me says,
“How beautiful.” I say, “This beautiful,” then split
a hair down the middle. I lied, “I made it myself,”
then stood up to fade through painstaking
humiliation. As a child, a girl, I saw through myself
to age 45. It was then when I first noticed the aching
of my hands, how they were soon to set themselves
away — they came and went, as if they were lace for the breaking.xiii
I was reciting Alfred, Lord Tennyson on my back,
in a canoe, floating the holiest way I knew — 
so close to ghost, and went pale for a moment
before finding myself wandering among high pines.
I didn’t expect to emerge in white already
with my heart in his hand, just as normal
as a shell rests on my chest. Didn’t expect
to hand it over so early on, at the boundary
of our properties in a dream: in the grasses
where he ended and I began. I’m feeling very still
now that we’ve crossed over into the pale,
where we are soon to thread, soon to embellish,
then loop back into each other: braided the way
we were taught to approach each other — the same way.

glass fragments spreading against a glistening sunset

at a drive-up window informs me,too bad, you know nothing of your own past
how far will I walk against the night?

some years later, under the kitchen table, they all huddle,
as the rampage continues toward the back of the house,

every day dawn finds herself naked and wonders if she has not in fact lost herself entirely in the night, her clothes, precepts, selfhood. what comes of a preposition, of love, some penetrated interiority. in this new and sudden opening, there is the fragile pink of sky, the lip of wind. dawn is not alone in her discomfort. the sun too is heavy with the previous day’s misfortunes. neither can bear the tentative movement of the other. she would withdraw safely into the darkness but sun is thick limbed, blocking the door. dawn walks backward toward the window, her legs shimmering with light. she will fall — she always does — upward, into the buoyancy of it. there will be witnesses. it does not matter who. for dawn there is only the swarm of light, the heady rush of it. everything else is incidental.

there is a story we tell. a story about suffering. not because we are only suffering, but because that is the story we have been taught to tell. take a beetle for instance. it talks of nothing other than the leaf it chews. the angularity of it. the soft brush underneath. there are many beetles. far more than there are humans. somehow our voices always drown them out. take crows for instance. they have been known to fish. not with their beaks but with fiberglass poles left idle by drunken fishermen. or maybe they are just sleeping. either way the crow speaks only of fish. the cold flesh. the fragile meat. in the story i tell myself there are often buffalo. not because they are prolific, but because they occupy the expanse of my memory, its continent. the buffalo are only a metaphor. snow is also a metaphor. bodies blanketed in white. freezing. we are all rigid with it. the story. tell something different. something about the rain. the sound of it. like walking skyward. away from one’s origins. what has been culled from one atmosphere falling gently into another.

energy is an attribute of objects. we often mistake the boulder for something other than. he is drawn to the laboratory dome, a concrete formation sitting cross-legged on the mountainside. as if protesting movement. as if unmovable. he finds breathing difficult, the opening and closing. he avoids people who demand such things. there are those who objected to nuclear fission, to anything being split in two. inside the concrete building, he finds the guts of the machine, metal tentacles wrapping around the bulbous head of an octopus. he stations himself at the tentacle’s tip and measures the distance electrons travel when driven from their source. a hundred years ago scientists believed that fission could split the world into sequences of light. they were right. he scatters particles, drives elements far from their nucleus. to create such structural injury. we continue to.

                ","
We didn’t know my mother was driving
back to her childhood, with a ring
of keys, a compass, and a tiger
panting in the back seat. Soon enough
the tiger was behind the wheel, circling.
And each circle spun further and
further away from us. When she calls,
the tiger has parked the yellow-striped taxi
on the highway’s rough shoulder. It’s time,
she says, for this dream to be over. Time
to go home, sleep in her own bed.
If the compass ever worked, she’s forgotten
how to read it, and the ring for the keys
is broken, the keys melted down
for their metal. If I would just call someone
and tell him where she is. She has money —
she can pay someone to drive her home.
If only a road sign were in sight, but no, there’s
only scattered chert and farmland
and a man across the road who is not my father.
Behind the wheel the hungry tiger’s
yellow eyes are slightly open. Behind the wheel
the tiger snacks on the summer of 1970 and
the entire works of Iris Murdoch.
Caught in his teeth are recipes for chocolate mousse
and coq au vin, my brother’s first arrest, the one-
room schoolroom where her mother taught.
So who to call? The tiger, sated for the nonce,
has started snoring. The quick drive by,
today disguised as children. The tiger snores away.

Late fall the white fur grew up your spine
thick as the tail of a marten. You built up the fire,
wrapped your legs with skins, but how that
chill wind broke through sill and jamb.
We stuffed paper in every crevice — an uncle’s will,
the writ that changed your name, a certificate
of Degree of Indian Blood and one that said O positive. Still
we shivered, your eyes yellow in the lantern’s light.
Always, they were out there, in a field of boulders
the size of bears hunched over. O, you were silky
with fur, with a sharp smell I could not get enough of.
I fell into a dream of milk and skin,
on the bed of pelts in the winter cabin. When I woke
they had taken you or you had gone with them.
And didn’t I, so green with sleep, track you
the three days until new snow fell?2
I packed flint and tinder and a compass
whose face shines in the lowest light.
I learned a song to map the way
and one to call you back.
I crouched over every footprint,
sniffing.And herewas a broken branch and here
something like hair caught by a bramble.
I followed and followed — all the yellow hours,
until I came to untouched earthand waited
in the clearing for the snow to come downwhite
as the winter blanket you long had wanted.3
In the spring when you
come down hungry from
that other mountain
the space between one rib
and the next deep enough
to lay my finger — 
how much of you will
remain or linger — 
bone or mouth or memory
of the first sadness of humans?
Will you dig from the crevices
the paper where they
wrote you down as this
instead of that? Or startle
at the clatter of plates?
The creak of the wooden bed?
Will your skin shake off
its fur, your claws remember
they were fingers? And the hands,
meaty as paws, soften into
what I once could stroke or suckle?

The Age of Gold cracked me up last night,
asters and sparrows to be exact,
that unrelenting knot in
the choral fire. It’s good exercise, to get out
on stage, to stand in the silvered chamber
and deny emptiness, when the pocket falls so deep
one could mark anything out over the top.
The India ink drops continuously,
its likeness, still Helen as phantom
not the truth of the state of her body
but being awash in a sound uprooted.
The desk is still a symbol I pile things on,
pin down elegies, illegible dates, introductions scrawled
on slender backs of envelopes, receipts, small machine-like
cloud chambers, talon disconnected.
Sunlight burns my feet putting away
the wet mop, where I am stopped
from almost killing myself. All that wobbling of the lensnonsense, I will cling to the truth of the soundtrack

enameled teeth of Tyrannosaurus rex•

to the point of flowers
Their lines are reaching
arms out from the center
Their lace is torn over
the image at points

the diamond district through a downpour
past the love-sick dungeons
of Dante, a cleaving after in Sappho,

I was glad to hear the black robes had given you this shimmer of elongated nights, left to waver in the void. They know how to die in battle. They are a twist in the black mirror, that river between the city and the mist. We will produce no sane men again. They come back different and the same. They roam over hills and plains and wish the heavens would fall. You issued the first soldiers and we only answered back, seeking air. I have sent many words that were drowned along the way.

I am not murdered, and I am not missing, but parts of me have been disappeared.
— Leanne Simpson



They too know all too well that some cracks were built just for us to fall through.  We live in a world that tries to steal spirits each day; they steal ours by taking us away.
From Industrial Schools to forced assimilation, genocide means removal  of those who birth nations — our living threatens. Colonization has been choking
us for generations. I tell my girls they are vessels of spirit, air to lungs expanding; this world cannot breathe without us. There are days  I wish
I didn’t have to teach these lessons, but as an Indigenous womxn  silence is deadening. There is danger in being seen, our bodies are targets
marked for violence. We carry the Earth’s me too inside us,  a howling wind, our mothers & their mothers swallowed these bullets long ago.
The voices ricochet I wish I were invisible I wish I were invisible  I wish echoes  in my eardrums — we know what it’s like to live in fear. Colonialism’s bullet sits cocked,
waiting behind a finger on trigger. We breathe and speak and sing  for survival. We carve out in lines; we write — I know joy I know pain I know loveI know love I know — lessons we’ve carried throughout time. Should I go missing: don’t stop searching; drag every river until it turns red and the waters of our names
stretch a flood so wide it catches everything. And we find each other whole and sacred, alive and breathing and breathing and breathing.

More absentmindedly walking the room, swishing about beyond argument or caging names. Calling out over the whole wet season, commercial speculations (cycles). I love that edge the wall makes — casino game-board green — my love comes bursting out the center of the glass (foiled) I abandon my trap in fragments.

I don’t understand this kindergarten
assignment: “Draw Your Clan.”
The three letters live in abstraction.
A friend suggests mine looks like his, minus
legs, and that day I believe my clan is
a species of amputee Snipes, birds
forced to fly the skies forever, and I
wonder if we are meant to symbolize
endurance or something beyond
my five-year-old comprehension.2
My mother explains we are not legless
birds and if she had a more worldly
vocabulary she would have suggested
we were ambiguous, not quite a fish,
more than a water snake, but she says
we are among the few. The last Tuscarora Eel
died out a generation ago, so we are left
Onondaga Eels among the Tuscarora,
voiceless as well as legless.3
I find an encyclopedia photo,
see jagged rows of razor teeth
in a mouth perpetually grinning
and when I show it to her, she says
clans are a system to keep track
of families, so we don’t inadvertently
marry our relatives, and that we have no
more affinity with eels than anyone else
on the reservation has with their animals.4
“If I threw you in the dike,” she says
“you’d drown as fast as anyone else,” done
with this lesson. I remember older cousins,
swimming between my legs, and suddenly I am rising,
their hands grabbing my knees as my balls collide
with the backs of their necks, and they break
the surface, toss me into deeper water, probably
watching to make sure I surface, after they’ve had
some amusement at my struggle.5
In wet darkness, I imagine opening
my eyes and mouth, taking water in,
filling my lungs, discovering gills
like Aquaman or Namor, the Sub-mariner.
Knowing I had better odds of dying, face down,
no voice to call out for help, I am
never quite brave enough to try it, not daring
enough, even, to open my eyes when my face breaks
the stillness of river water contained.6
But I flip on my back, ears below the surface, listen
to mysteries, breathe shallowly at that level, and float,
wondering what it would be like to glide the depths
on fins, knowing if I were there, I would desire
legs and lungs, and then I fill my chest to capacity,
and dive, loving and begrudging the ache I find there,
the throbbing of my chest begging for release,
and I swim back up, eyes still closed, wondering how
long it will take to find the surface again.

I stood in a longhouse
with a woman who may or may not
be Mohawk. Some shift their opinions
about her like meteorologists, as if
her blood were a storm system tracked
in its comings and goings. But the father
of her two sons was, without question, Seneca.
We knew that, in Haudenosaunee country, a father
is to some degree irrelevant, that her own
shifting identity would impact her sons’ lives
like a gene vulnerable to betrayal, causing
certain, terminal conditions. She waited
on an elder she called Steam (warning I was not
to call the elder woman by that name). Steam
(not Steam) would observe the boys, understand
their natures, give them their Creator names defining
their lives during the next ceremony. I confessed
my namelessness, confessed my longhouse- and fluency-
deficient community, and confessed that my clan
mother, three hours away, did not know me well
enough to give me a name, confessed my community followed
a more casual ceremony. You find your name after a social misstep,
a dubious facial feature, a birth defect. Names offer
the name-givers comfort, that your challenge is harder
than theirs, no matter the truth.
Our names are a convoluted toughening of our skins. My name
is not like Steam (no one is forbidden to use it). No one
calls me Batman because of my status, my utility
belt, my impressive batpole, my agility, my muscles,
my profile in spandex, my virtues, but because I wore
the cape to an older age than I should have, and could
continue to wear it now, as that shit is not going away
any time soon. Even kids who only know Christian Bale
or Michael Keaton, lurking in latex and leather hood,
still think Batman is my name.
And this is why I have no memory for when or how you became
the Bumblebee, what it means, beyond the literal.
You soar in gardens, spend days ensuring growth,
and if metaphors are at work here, this one seems true
enough to keep you in amber wings, fuzzy yellow rings,
black lacquer torso, and sensitive antennae.
What metaphor suits the night I left on the Amtrak
for Chicago, past 1:00 a.m., while you stood
on the platform, watching those cars pull out,
the night I wanted to leap from the train, stay?
I cannot invent new names for the ways we slow,
struggle, attempt to maintain the illusion of futures
without measure, defy actuary numbers and because I have
gone closer to the light than you have, the story is
easier to craft and finesse than it should be.
Pollination trails are smaller than those I’m forced
to fly in, and lying in Little Rock, Santa Fe, Manhattan,
Minneapolis, Seattle, hotel rooms, the ellipse of your name
trail winds me home, waiting, dusted in pollen and history.

              spin-cycled through a craftsman’s
              circumpolar hands. There’s always
              another grotto or chamber
              where things dwell, they say.
              Wandering skitterers we are,
              the Northern Lights vacuum pried-open skulls.
                            We cover ourselves with hides and entrails,
                            overripe elderberries, looking to steal a moment
                            of letup from the glare. The limbs of the Old Ones
                            shunt aside bare toes, stripped solid
                            and indifferent as a bear’s den
                            or an ant’s apartment.
Don’t be so much in charge, the frogs say,
              of coalescing wolverine trails
              huddled in 60-million-year pellet tracks
              when the wetlands dried out.
The way soaked, green corpuscles
              rasp each other’s mouths and hands
              braiding the woof of God’s mind,
              that’s how it is, says
              the giant rat’s captive wife.
Even if you can only faintly hear
              the eighth narrative told in the corner
              of the babbling wooden-slat house,
              that is enough leftover hooligan grease
              for the gods with killer whale ganglia.
Knuckles rasp proscenium floorboards,
              splattering herring peck at scops owl’s waist,
              spruce branch
              lowered,
              scrapes conglomerate bedrock.Mother-in-law’s atonic hands lunge for stewed milt.
One can conclude it’s a virus
              to plant burdensome layers
              of topographic crust on self-renewing
              limbs, like there was more to it
              than rustling fingers at the end of the line.
All components must be in order,
              or it’s an ulcer here, a bladder infection
              there, a baked-out parking lot,
              fizzing in trampled-over, chastened hairlines.
Hold, hold, hold, hold in your palms
              the Steller’s jay that beats its wings
              on glaciers lying high and straight
              over rivers slicing into cool nettles.
Sea lions suck up a quick breath, dive
              and waft on the outskirts of ballerinas
              who gyrate in like-mind
              to classics bubbling up from Sedna’s citadels.
I’m here to show you what you can do
              with this sandbar dialect,
              says the humpback whale
              and the goatsbeard moss, and the ore
              of iron oxide in the shoreline cliff.
You must trust, she says,
                            your swimming blood, joints
                            lumbering in shadows, the dolphin
                            clicking out to you, far above ground.
                            And we should feed just as much as eat,
                            says the heart your body formed around.

To be a bride of my own lamentation
I wear a dress not of time’s poisoned quills
but feathers of discontent — kingfishers
ghosting in cornstalks, my field of frozen flutes.
The edge of descent, digression’s highway
brings a particulate ash to my mouth,
starry metals of the meadow’s cold snap,
ravens in the sycamore scorched to black.
I follow their echo’s loop and chase.
I master the map of never, raft
its fragments, mouth the brightness of human’s
leftover snow, details of fever-clouds
where the convent dissolves in violence.
I wear the canyon like a blank eye,
lay before the never-returning light
my silhouette, fossil of the drowned town’s scroll.•
Here, where your ghost is always departing
the ebb and flow of terrestrial tides,
I follow your echo’s loop and chase,
vortex streets of a cylindrical sound
infinite in its arrangements of light.
The evening veil, a partial reveal — 
how I appear to myself looking past
this fact of being underway. Each day
I stow my earthen materials
in preparation for the never-end.
In the snapshot of my dead friend, hanging
in the room where loved ones refuse return:
a gradual reduction of color.
Running out of time, neck-deep in water,
we knew no one was coming to help us
in the same way one denies language
to come from a picture. I imagine
love a revelation, not of mind — 
the blue gauze of planetary motion — 
a tone-on-tone painting of a body
floating on the sea’s shifting horizons.
It is a question of legibility.
When I became tired of depicting
poetry, I became aware of
another kind of plane, the kind
good for dwellings and their narrative escape.
Here children sit up all night by the flames — 
the orphan boy from blood-stained pottery
who singed his head and burned out both his eyes.
That was your life, a prefix for fire.
Spider will weave a ladder to your heart,
it is said, even though you are sleeping,
intoxicated by abandonment,
a bitter wind reminiscent of a wave.•
In the last days of my marriage to god,
I wandered his spiraled library
to read in the dark blank imprints of trees.
Relentless navigation through the stacks
of shell-tempered mortuary offerings,
sandstone saws recovered from the caves.
I lingered on the stairs of the convent
to write these things, to recollect myself.
Around midnight the mountains returned.
The clouds dispersed into semicolons
and I with them, into a new language,
its boat temporary, invisible.
I knew I would be traveling like this
for centuries. This was my first attempt
at vanishing. I would return before
anyone noticed poems to be found
in the forest, not the mind.
There’s a canyon between this version of me
and the shadow in the corner that is mine.
I wear this canyon like a blank eye.
