“I’m interested in feminist oratory,” we think
Jess should say
“Specifically that.”
 
Yellow-breasted engine sounds on the
Joshua tree
Joshua tree mid-shimmy
 
I think every bird is mad
at me. Does that make me
an alcoholic?
 
Let’s take a break, after
the great San Bernardino sculpture party
 
sparkling toilet pieces lay tiled into
the pavilion,
silver flushers too.
 
TV piles. I am
uneasy. So what?
No match for the always sand and always
 
Air. I find a pair of leather pants
Hanging in a hut & touch them.
Definitely not leather.
 
I can see the sunscreen on your face
not rubbed in,
rivulets wet
 
the under-chin. Let’s get this next pitch
right, guys,
decades left of percolation.

I find the heavens beautiful,
I find the earth so too,
the seas and the ground,
the furling of water and gas,
the bright distant points
of our isolation. I take comfort
in the swinging pendant traffic lights,
the slurry of wet raw flour.
I am programmed to this language,
and can only voice my rejection of it
in the same language.
This is the power of diaspora,
the difficulty in finding alternative.
Let us send messages to the half-existent.
To excuse oneself, to claim not knowing
the future, is inhuman. I am so worthless
that my body serves as brick,
conscripted to build up my prison
until it is time to lay my own body
down for the walls. It is mechanical,
snipping into the loop of every lace,
separating from every link
the cold wrapped bud. At first the skin
is thick and bright,
then darkly collapses.
Nothing keeps its shape,
nothing stands itself upright,
we keep sliding apart into smaller
and smaller components, and it is
in the air above us now,
we do not mingle with the outcome
of ideas any longer, the energy
that knows whether cruelty
is disinterested or rightful.
They are so happy
while we laugh at them,
their eyes enthused and shining
while we trick them
into hurting themselves.

It tastes like all my night
when I'm at the bottom of the borough
sheets burn around me
through the night
Consecrate me
Consecrate me
Conserve me lover
In the sills of your love
in the cells of your palms
from the womb to cell
break me from the belly of ship
let me crash upon you
Consecrate me my lover in your rectum
in a rehabilitation center where athletes seek the best care
I break into you
Consecrate me I want to love you in Syracuse woods
in Sonnino love me against lamb’s wool
I am my sister's wife keeper
Consecrate me
in the discretion of sisters
nuns loving
and hating jobs that ask

You’re leaving Las Vegas, except
In German. Point. Point. Point.
Gave it out, beautiful gentilhommeComme vous êtes, toujours,
Unforgettable, circa 2008 how
You made me cum like that -
She got so mad in the bed - the
Hotel bathroom floor,
The bathtub, the apartment where
I was the crying queen
 
Those o’s still unforgettable
And now Paris. I cried today OW!
Your Antarctica cold last
Night. You told me they fucked
You up / I told you he broke
My heart and OW! Freeze
Dried my bandaid right off.
And then the glasses shopping
Memories today yada yada
Wasn’t about the cum shot
Where or if, was about the
Islands and how you said
in the langue d’enemie
No less: “DON’T TOUCH”
 
Don’t Touch!? We just …
They fucked you up all right.
You give so clearly but have iced
Out all the incoming gifts. WELL
PING my darling Walden island.
I can’t take that kind of cold.I’m leaving Las Vegas.
Just a moon in Taurus trying
To sing the sweet and
It’s not a great user experience
 
But I just want you to know
How unforgettable you are
 
 
When the candles call to Hera
I hope they melt your
I hope a goddess or many
Wash that loneliness away
And when I see you again (in 15 years)
There’s only joy and more
 
I prefer you laughing to tears
The good way. Drink us when
We’re done. Well, I guess I did
Almost kill you with a
Razor shave once so it
Seems silly to say I’m sorry I
Lost the phantom thread.
Maybe everything’s a ridiculous
never-ending non-planet
Tho, u did kiss me like unicorns
Exist and bond our skin
Like the organ it deserves to be
Known as
 
 
To know how unforgettable
you are because there
lies the bridge to the
Mainland. & baby, you
Deserve it all.

If you want to know the truth today’s my birthday
and though I often feel older, and sometimes appear younger
I’m 31, and like everything else that too can be fun
or a bummer, a drain on the cosmic energy, depending on what?
If you know the answer you win the future;
if you don’t the future is ours to lose or—
whatever happened to the old way of construction?
Well, one line still follows another, and my voices moves
between each space, and when I think of you I sweat,
or maybe just imagine myself like a cartoon troublemaker
big beads of perspiration jumping out from my skin as I
cringe behind the fence that the bully is about to
throw a bomb over, or drop an anvil over, or just put his
meaty fist through and right on into my scared shitless grin,
the analogy resting on our mutual vulnerability—
that’s poetry isn’t it?

And now it’s time to go back to THE HISTORY OF ROCK’N’ROLL
which means it’s my night to cook dinner for “the house”—
collective—and it’s gonna be smoked sausage cooked in peppers
and mushrooms and carrots, maybe some onions, and beans
for protein, or something nutritional. I picked the sausage
because it seemed to be looking at me in the Safeway,
not exactly the way I was looking at one of the cashiers,
a young man with curly blonde hair and nice build
who seemed to have a down home kind of friendliness,
or the woman with the little girl the same sizes as Miles,
who is a little smaller than Caitlin, both of whom were
pulling on my pants leg for pennies for gumballs as I watched
the curve of the woman’s arm as she placed each
well thought over item on the counter behind my
vibrational buying and didn’t even notice how much I fell in love
with her arm and felt guilty for objectifying a part of her
although she might all be like her arm and then I might
fall in love with all of her, but that would cause problems,
she probably is already in love with at least one person, and
I’m already in love with about fourteen on a regular basis, and
that keeps causing all kinds of problems because people who are
attracted to my style don’t like my ways—that sounded like
a pretentious folk singing prodigy’s idea of an early Dylan line,
but what I meant would never be explained right in a poem like this,
or one like Anne Waldman’s either though I like to read hers
because they make me want to write, and in my world that’s what
“great” writers are supposed to do–make everyone else, or
at least me, feel like I can write too, and then make me feel,
like I will, and then I do.
                                                                                  *
 
After dinner we’ll eat the cake Atticus made for my birthday
there’ll be some presents from some of the people in the house, and
maybe Annie will stop over, or Matthew might call from work, or we
might all go down to watch him make salads at
                                               FOOD FOR THOUGHT,
and maybe eat some too, all along getting stoned on the house doobie,
which goes too fast these days but never fast enough, which is
about the way I feel on my birthday about my life, either that or
the way I’m easily satisfied but never feel I can get too much–
sometimes everything is enough, you know?

There’s coffee and pie
with a widow from church.
Why do you sit
in the back pew? she asks.
I’m close enough, I say.
Can I sit back there with you?
I’ve always sat there, I tell her,
with my same two friends,
and their clicking oxygen pumps.
One sat next to me for years,
called herself my church girlfriend,
who metastasized, telling me she was
tired of waiting to die.
Now, there’s just my 88-year-old friend,
his pump echoing in the sanctuary,
and there’s that empty
space between us.
I’d like to invite the widow to sit there,
but I miss my dead friend’s laugh,
her loving stories about her husband,
and how we were always
glad to see one another.
I tell the widow all this.
What if I just sat there? she asks.
It’s a free country, I tell her,
and she smiles.

In the pink light,
haloes of cloud form over the mountains;
lightning, two valleys away,
then, not an hour later,
 
the explosion of thunder.
The roadrunners
pecking for breadcrumbs on the porch
have long since fled into the rabbitbrush,
 
into the endless ocean of grass.
Driving in every direction
down licks of red road, I have lost
myself in a militarized topography;
 
everything named after army units,
generals, scouts, miners…The Dragoon Mountains,Cochise Stronghold; defunct
 Gleeson and Pearce,
weird, rusty ghost towns, the only
non-derelict structure
for miles, the local school,
 
its polished windows and well-kept lawn,
a source of great local pride.
No mountain monograms
for these desiccated whistle-stops,
 
no giant Q or C or W in bright
white paint to mark
the township's still functional
sorta functional breathing, no
 
carving for them
into the planet's bark;
and thus they are blesséd
to me like no other;
 
every successful city
is a flimsy affair with civility,
its eternalness, like Paris or Rome,
mere hypocrisy.
 
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN,
BUY REAL ESTATE! Hail follows rain.
Nearby, the township of Sunsites,
once billed as the safest
 
spot to survive
the inevitable nuclear winter,
actually topped Soviet Russia's
list of high-priority targets… Enter
 
the Orange Duck Candidate.
A haboob sweeps across
the Valley of the Senile.
In a week, the mountains
 
have switched from brown
to purple to green.
The desert is human
endeavour's most fitting graveyard;
 
the slow bleaching,
the gradual eroding into sand,
the heat stifling sound as it leaps into the air.
IT CAN'T HAPPEN HERE. But it always does.

We must have known,
Even as we reached
Down to touch them
Where we'd found them
 
Shut-eyed and trembling
Under a straw bale
In the haymow, that
She would move them
 
That night under cover
Of darkness, and that
By finding them
We were making certain
 
We wouldn't see them again
Until we saw them
Crouching under the pickup
Like sullen teens, having gone
 
As wild by then as they'd gone
Still in her mouth that night
She made a decision
Any mother might make
 
Upon guessing the intentions
Of the state: to go and to
Go now, taking everything
You love between your teeth.

In the next scene Walt Whitman
is walking around Boston
Common. He’s young.
It’s winter. Emerson
is there. They walk
and talk for hours, or really
Emerson talks. He scolds
Whitman for slavering
after tree knots and bobbing
with the swimmer. Whitman nods
but in his head he’s busy
tallying his orgasms.
At the carousel
an ancient Puritan is passing
his hat, singing, “Kill It Babe.”
Dozens of geese have gathered
on the frozen pond,
standing on one leg,
tucking the other like a dagger
into their feathery centers.
Well, Emerson asks the poet,
what do you have to say for yourself?
And Whitman, respectfully,
but sure now
all the way down in his bones
where the deep, frontier feeling
of disobedience lives, says,
essentially, go fuck yourself.
I’ll go my own way.

                ","
Give up sitting dutifully at your desk. Leave
your house or apartment. Go out into the world.
 
It's all right to carry a notebook but a cheap
one is best, with pages the color of weak tea
and on the front a kitten or a space ship.
 
Avoid any enclosed space where more than
three people are wearing turtlenecks. Beware
any snow-covered chalet with deer tracks
across the muffled tennis courts.
 
Not surprisingly, libraries are a good place to write.
And the perfect place in a library is near an aisle
where a child a year or two old is playing as his
mother browses the ranks of the dead.
 
Often he will pull books from the bottom shelf.
The title, the author's name, the brooding photo
on the flap mean nothing. Red book on black, gray
book on brown, he builds a tower. And the higher
it gets, the wider he grins.
 
You who asked for advice, listen: When the tower
falls, be like that child. Laugh so loud everybody
in the world frowns and says, ""Shhhh.""
 
Then start again.

In the grassy space between the wings of the elementary school and the trailers housing the fifth grade’s overflow classrooms, girls flip their hair in imitation of Cindy Crawford, sing Iko Iko. None of you know what it means or where the song comes from.
It’s honor-roll season, a time of outings to TCBY and Outback Steakhouse. Your mother warns you against filling up on bread, but it’s hard to resist the little brown loaves brought warm to the table with soft butter – a luxury that cannot be imagined at home, with its always-refrigerated margarine and Pepperidge Farm sandwich loaves.
Everyone knows what’s popular but nobody knows how to act. At ten, you lack any context. The world swims before you, and it constantly stings. Its favorite barb: “everybody knows that.”
Beyond the grassy space of girls is more grass, a quarter-mile loop of track, a church with a painfully white spire, a fence, and a neighborhood maybe a little less nice than yours, crammed between the school and busy Great Neck Road. The fence is of chain link, instead of wooden slats. That’s how you know about the niceness – that and the something hard, like a grain of sand, you feel in your mother’s voice, when she takes you to the school’s Spring Fling, where you win another goldfish. They always die, but you’re getting better. Now, it takes a while.Loblollies shiverIn May heat. The world’s ending.The world’s a mirage.

For Janna



The tiny journalist
will tell us what she sees.
 
Document the moves, the dust,
soldiers blocking the road.
 
Yes, she knows how to take a picture
with her phone. Holds it high
 
like a balloon. Yes, she would
prefer to dance and play,
 
would prefer the world
to be pink. It is her job to say
 
what she sees, what is happening.
From her vantage point everything
 
is huge—but don’t look down on her.
She’s bigger than you are.
 
If you stomp her garden
each leaf expands its view.
 
Don’t hide what you do.
She sees you at 2 a.m. adjusting your
 
impenetrable vest.
What could she have
 
that you want? Her treasures,
thing shiny buttons her grandmother loved.
 
Her cousin, her uncle.There might have been a shirt. . .
 
The tiny journalist notices
action on far away roads
 
farther even than the next village.
She takes counsel from bugs so
 
puffs of dust find her first.Could that be a friend? 
 They pretended not to see us.They came at night with weapons. 
 What was our crime? That we likedrespect as they do? That we have pride? 
 
She stares through a hole in the fence,
barricade of words and wire,
 
feels the rising fire
before anyone strikes a match.
 
She has a better idea.

for my granddaughter, Wahcawin



I didn’t want to scold the sky that year, but
 Grandma’s words taunted my senses. If there
is a thirst, then you need to pity the flowers
 
in a loud voice. Ask the frogs why they are
being punished, stomp on the ground and talk
to the dried clay about cracking open the earth.
 
I know challenging the storm is risky. “Last
but not least, burn cedar and pray the lightning
doesn’t strike your town.” That night, the stars
 
disappeared, so did the birds. Perhaps it was
the season for rain or the dance. In the western
distance, we thought we heard cannon blasts,
 
looking over we watched the horizon fill with
lightning strikes. Rain couldn’t pour hard enough
over the thirsty plain. Accompanying clouds,
 
called to thunder’s voice in extreme decimals
requesting all the water heaven could send forth,
to come. Rain and more rain filled empty stream
 
bottoms. Rivers who had pulled their dry banks
farther and farther from their center begged for
a drink to startle dusty beds with a flooding roar.
 
Lives in dormant places begin to stir and awaken.
 The lives of water beings, those that swim, the
ones that hop, and the ones that fly, begin to stir.
 
That year all thirst was quenched.

Tracks are all that define these voices,
hungry lives pulsing sacred ground.
We are a journey of distressed shapes,
red essence on parchment, occupying a life.
We look for the fated four-legged that paced
this way, a tested and well-worn path
among storms, mud, into this shared hidden
brush. Coyote, slipping by through old
winter grass, warns in a pagan tongue,
licking after our scent. We pick up pace,
tighten our careless reins, snap back at the
yellow-eyed clown with throat hunger,
that gnawing bone that drives us on. Quieted,
we hear the heart beating. A desperate breath
crashes through dry branches, a silhouette
give away. In an instant we let go
of weapons and invite a quick death. We
watch our knives glistening. Obsidian
works for us. What image of blood on flesh,
odor of iron. A vermilion sun heavy with
spring looks upon reflections of death
in hard visions, our favorable hunt—
whitetail not quick enough for downwind
lessons. Our horses burdened, deer shadows
left on landscape, we push forward.
These tracks ours now. Game will heal all.

This morning we found ourselves skinning a deer,
cutting meat, hanging some to dry and packaging
some for the freezer. It was the dogs late last night
 
that set off a howling, the unexpected smell of fresh
blood floating down the block, then a familiar car
horn honking in the driveway. My nephew and his
 
friends were hunting and brought us a deer. Mother
always said, “Cut up the meat right away, don’t let
it sit.” I look at a front quarter, a hole filled with
 
coagulated blood. Grandma says not to eat the part
next to the wound, “Cut it out; offer it to the earth for
healing, a sacrifice to remember the hungering spirits.”
 
Auntie says to save the muscle along the back strap,
“It makes good thread.” I carefully learned the exact
place to cut the joints so the bones separate easily.
 
Mother said that is important—“It means you are a
thoughtful person.” Auntie is at the door waiting for
a roast. “An elder takes the first piece,” she reminded.
 
Mom tells me to save the hooves for her. She wants
to make a bone game for the new grandchild, wants
him to be patient and skillful. I boil the hoofs with
 
sage, find the little toe-bones for her. My hands begin
to ache from the work, I soak them in warm water
and start again. I admire the placement of tendons
 
on the deer shoulders, no joints, just the crisscrossing
of muscle. Grandma says, “That’s why your dad called
them jumpers, they bounce off the strength of their
 
flexing muscles.” Late at night Mom helps me stake
out the hide. My back hurts; my feet feel like I’ve
been walking on rocks all day. I want to complain,
 
but Mom catches the look in my eyes. She says to me,
“When you get dressed for the dance this weekend,
you will proudly wear your beautiful beaded dress,
 
your beaded leggings and moccasins, and last, but not
least, you will put on your beaded belt, and attached
you will wear your sharp knife and quilled knife sheath
 
because of what you have done this day.”

The future is as sterile as a robot’s loincloth.
I drown my hands in sanitizer until they pucker.
 
Where this soapbox tree germinates, I collect
my germs and make a fountain of them.
 
Because yellow is yarrow and soot, and the future,
I’ve learned, is no suture. Because where I’m from,
these kisses are infections. Because dirt’s
 
ammunition against discipline, the blood fills
my clean mouth with dismay. Am I surprised—
Hollywood still assumes we are all the bastard
 
children of the same evil dictator? That phosgene
and mustard will rack our titanium Maoist husks
until some white man with slanty eyes rescues us
 
from our mealy, pliant selves? Am I to wear Dior,
wrap my mouth in bloody tulle, before kneeling,
bending to kiss a mouth dirtied by Pantone 136?
 
No fucking thanks. Because where I’m from,
these kisses are infractions. Darlings, let’s rewrite
the script. Let’s hijack the narrative, steer
 
the story ourselves. There’d be a heist, a battle.
Audre Lorde would write the script. My leading
man would be Bruce. We’d earn our happy ending.
 
Instead, they give me 1981. 2012. Quantum quasars,
new dystopia—plutonium wars. We’re not in Polanski’s
Chinatown anymore. Yet we still have the same bowl
 
haircuts. Bangs, big bang, a city of fetid promise, new
minor galaxy where we cannot touch. Instead our skin
is rust and metal. It gratifies the technophile in all of us.

In the autumn I moved to New York,
I recognized her face all over the subway
stations—pearls around her throat, she poses
for her immigration papers. In 1924, the only
Americans required to carry identity cards
were ethnically Chinese—the first photo IDs,
red targets on the head of every man, woman,
child, infant, movie star. Like pallbearers,
they lined up to get their pictures taken: full-face
view, direct camera gaze, no smiles, ears showing,
in silver gelatin. A rogue’s gallery of Chinese
exclusion. The subway poster doesn’t name
her—though it does mention her ethnicity,
and the name of the New-York Historical
Society exhibition: Exclusion/Inclusion.
Soon, when I felt alone in this city, her face
would peer at me from behind seats, turnstiles,
heads, and headphones, and I swear she wore
a smile only I could see. Sometimes my face
aligned with hers, and we would rush past
the bewildered lives before us—hers, gone
the year my mother was born, and mine,
a belt of ghosts trailing after my scent.
In the same aboveground train, in the same
city where slain umbrellas travel across
the Hudson River, we live and live.
I’ve left my landline so ghosts can’t dial me
at midnight with the hunger of hunters
anymore. I’m so hungry I gnaw at light.
It tunnels from the shadows, an exhausting
hope. I know this hunger tormented her too.
It haunted her through her years in L.A., Paris,
and New York, the parties she went to, people
she met—Paul Robeson, Zora Neale Hurston,
Langston Hughes, Gertrude Stein. It haunts
her expression still, on the 6 train, Grand
Central station, an echo chamber behind
her eyes. But dear universe: if I can recognize
her face under this tunnel of endless shadows
against the luminance of all that is extinct
and oncoming, then I am not a stranger here.

this morning I went to the doctor
and talked to him about this move
 
on New Year’s Eve I had trouble connecting
my thoughts on Sade and reason
 
we rang in the New Year
with Miriam Makeba’s Africa
 
I’d noticed that my inner life
had expanded, and that I was having trouble
 
thinking through it. The doctor said that Geodon
would loosen my thinking—I noticed
 
that I’d been moving through life for 10 years
in a Zyprexa mold. thought control, at its best,
 
like a sonnet. I do not feel invaded
by the television that I never see. Brenda made me
 
feel more loved than ever this morning, as my thoughts
expanded. Last night, in the slow cooker, I made
 
Lamb and Goat curry—amazingly good. I’d thought
to send Joel, and Peter, and Michael an email
 
letting them know of my transition, but did not. The consequences
of this transition could be catastrophic. I feel more loving toward Brenda
 
than ever. I could die, or worse. As I meditated today
my books to the left of me seemed packed and dense
 
against the wall. Soon, Chuck will be here
to play chess upstairs. I told the doctor this morning
 
that the philosophy and religion of the cyborg
have not yet been written. My
 
poetry
has just begun. I am
 
a Fourth Form,
though not as Dodie saw it. Together,
 
we can belong in this world. Artaud
arrived at the double
 
as I have. We share more in common
than I’d known before last night. I need less sleep
 
than before, and I sleep better
and am more rested. I feel sad and cheated
 
that I need to rely on drugs
so completely. I wonder about Paul Bowles’ stories.
 
I need to reach out
to others
 
through this. The doctor, this morning, said
that I was enlightened, but not
 
quite there—somehow—I can’t remember
how. I doubt he knows
 
what he means by “enlightenment.” I felt far away
from my sister yesterday, when she called. Michael
 
talked to me of Christ’s
tenderness. I feel tender in this moment. Over
 
and over I feel that words
do not represent me. I am not
 
sure what that implies of my intentions
in using them. Yesterday, Brenda and I saw
 
the Warhol show of the last ten years
of his life. There seemed to have been hope
 
to live meaningfully in capitalism then. ~~~~~~~ The waves
of this beginning, the new life of my mind
 
is settling. It’s been a while since I’ve written. I’ve decided
to mark my continuing with the seven tildes above. And I added
 
a title tonight, Muerto Vecino, after Zizek’s dubious interpretation
of Kierkegaard’s neighbor, and because of the funeral home
 
across the street. My thinking has changed, my being has changed,
I am more alert and more engaged in thinking through the world.
 
And I am able to speak better. I don’t know what this means
about who I am. I try not to feel let down that for so much of my life
 
I’ve been restrained by psychotropic drugs. Before Zyprexa it was even
worse, with up to 6 meds, as I’ve said over and over to friends. I feel
 
the need to make clear what my obstacles have been. Not for pity,
a little for pride, but also for hope. If I can do that, then maybe I can help
 
someone not suffer so much, like Brenda. I replaced the kitchen faucet
this past weekend. It makes me very happy that I was able to do it
 
successfully, without ever having been handy before in my life, and after
spending most of my life disdainful of being practical in that way. What a joy
 
to make Brenda so happy. I don’t know how much longer I will live,
and have often thought, recently, that it would be tragic if I died anytime
 
soon, but that it’s imperative that I accept death when it arrives, after
affirming life as fully as I can. It’s too easy, and stupid, to be simplistically
 
oppositional. And to not know that people can ruin anything, but
that the substantial things have value of themselves, is foolish. I don’t want to stop
 
at my own ignorance and lack of forbearance. I don’t believe in the West
on its own. As Michael says, the only thing that makes sense here
 
is love. I have everything I could possibly ever want or need for now. More books
will come, more music too. And love is immeasurable
 
when it’s real. I am so grateful to have more waking time
on the weekends. I plan on making breakfast for Brenda
 
every Saturday and Sunday that I can
from now on. Early. I see gardens in the future of our household.
 
And I wonder about a Great Spirit. What does the name matter? I see the stones that live
without water. I see the smoke that cleanses my vision, and a network of consciousness,
 
with each node another, on and on that way to the depths. My thinking will never
grasp it all
 
because of that recursively created network of interior life. My thinking stops
then, barely able to contain the spherical and vast darkness
 
from which all light arises. That’s why what I see is dark. It is brilliant
in its darkness. Like onyx and flint. I can only talk around what I’ve seen
 
the past couple of weeks. It reframes, completely, the rest of my creative
life and the rest of my days. All I aim to do now is to focus my attention,
 
so that I can see it all again in retrospect. So that I can read
and gather more tools for understanding it. So that I understand myself,
 
and something of the world, and love, and so that I help others. Geodon
will not erase it. I’ve seen it already, many times. It is my natural state.
 
I no longer see it as only hallucination. It is a way of being. A way that I can flesh
out, here. Slowly. Carefully. And as I do, its destructive powers,
 
which are massive and righteous, will subside. As it will know that it is being
given to the world. Because it belongs to all. And all will be there soon.
 
There are signs already. Because to see it is to break, unless one knows something
of love. It makes LSD
 
small. It is God and the Universe as One.
I am not the first to see it. But I am a person
 
given a chance
to write it, letter by letter, slowly, in terms of the light of my ignorance
 
to see more fully
what I do not know. I do not offer anything
 
but poems. But it breaks through
my mouth to arrive at the hearts of the world, at the hearts of the horses
 
of the world, to allow us all to speak in silence. It is not God or the Universe.
It is One as All in you. Because I cannot see through myself
 
without it. I see clearly
that the sun will not arrive
 
in this new weather. But that the moon
will take its place. I see clearly that the sun is there
 
to bring meaning to the sky, and that the earth is more full
with the light of the world
 
extinguished for a brilliant view of wilderness. This is a view
that extends through opposites
 
and arrives at a single body
to witness this song. And this song is not the answer
 
that you believe in, because one day
I will speak to you again
 
in the rain
and show you
 
that I do not know. Because knowledge
belongs to the earth. And the earth makes everything
 
I know. And now that there is less and less freedom
from coercion in a moneyed world, and now that Claire,
 
a friend, is moving on to be Christ in her own way, now
that Guénon continues to call me to understand
 
my ignorance, to depart again
from the friends at Kuna Yala, where I helped with the water,
 
with Brenda watching over me
from a hammock between palms, now that Panamá
 
calls again to give me a union
of the world, in more than two ways,
 
and to distinguish from the surface of these times, I
receive
 
a call to awaken in the snow. I receive a call to acknowledge
that Geodon has planted itself
 
with capital
in my consciousness, but that the world
 
is stronger than to balance itself
from the ozone and people alone. We are not erased, and we
 
do not control the earth. Geodon
is an act of kindness, an agreement
 
to live this life
in a way that arrives
 
with the weather. It may continue
for the rest of my life, or it may not. I will not be afraid again
 
to see things as I do, and I will not
seek out the truth, intentionally, without some kind of agreement
 
with this custom. Because that is a way, for now,
that I speak. And it is useful, though better left
 
invisible. And the name, Geodon, brings trouble, I can see
through it enough, with enough love in my life, to believe
 
in the end of the reign of the Anti-Christ (not Obama). I need to learn again
to be and to write. But to deliver
 
what I saw
I must return
 
to the explosion of my inner life. To start with, otherwise and generally, I see
only outlines. Creation manifests
 
from every direction, in an infinity
of dimensions. Most of us
 
spend most of our energy
conscious of a very few of these dimensions. Imagine
 
more than the greatest works of art
manifesting endlessly
 
from more directions than one can possibly count
every micro second, timelessly. It’s glorious.
 
And the only way to see it with any balance
is impeccably, ethically, compassionately, and with at least an aim
 
toward the Divine. It IS the Divine. God and the Universe
spoke to me. It is all, always, speaking to us. And what it says
 
is endless
it brings wholeness
 
to the precious moment. It goes away
when one tries to pin it down, as I do. I say less and less
 
as I try to describe it. It is endlessly
generative. It is good
 
but pitiless and merciful. It demands of us
that we arrive. And now that the thinking manifests
 
in a way that allows
for union and a bridge, in a way that avoids
 
easy condemnation, a thinking that reveals
the links toward light
 
in motion, a primordial
form of being
 
in a new world that needs no one
to believe in it, a vast chasm
 
in what a bureaucracy of thought
tries to pin us down with, the hole in time
 
that allows us to be free
is here, we know it. All of us
 
can see through delusion. There is no road
in the aftermath of earthquakes, no need for the time
 
to extinguish the elements, no person
locked to your heart
 
in the morning, no water to drink
without thirst, no air is necessary to breathe
 
under the water of seeing, no
need for the earth to do anything
 
other than revolve, in this
new light. Space
 
undoes our links
to the immovable. We deliver
 
the undone to the plains
and see what the harvest
 
will fill with seed. The whole
does not exist
 
within outlines. All we can do
is move to it. The music
 
is unheard of
in this world. It exists
 
without origin. It is otherworldly,
primordial, and gentle. It vibrates,
 
equally, in the Lamb, in
the Lotus, in
 
the stones—there is no place
unknown to it. It is
 
music, and nothing more,
and nothing less. It is that
 
everywhere possible. It is harmonious
infinitely, and allows for any sound. To some
 
it might seem like noise, but that
is only the part. To achieve it
 
one need only listen. I cannot always
hear it, but I have
 
heard it. And now
in my new mind, I listen for it
 
undaunted and silent. I feel it filling
my body with love. Sometimes
 
I have horrific thoughts. But I am learning
that these are but strong notes
 
in the fullness
of the music
 
of my new mind. I can’t always hear the song,
but I feel it now. It makes all context
 
vast. I will receive it
as long as it is here. I will not push
 
one way or the other with it. It is a fullness
and does not want to be made
 
into a force. It is a force
without me, and only to the degree
 
to which this is true. No longer being able
to receive it
 
will imply a failure
of my imagination, of my ethics,
 
and my spirit. There is no way
to hold on to it. It serves
 
no one. And it includes us all. To continue to receive it
more fully
 
I grow. This implies
the world. It implies clarity. It implies
 
motion. But it rests motionlessly. If I have a softness in my voice
it is caused by this music. When I don’t
 
I feel less. My voice can be loud
to receive it, but this loudness
 
cannot be yoked
in outlines. There is nothing I can do.
 
There is nothing to expect. I can only
let it go. And I can only be afraid
 
of the horror of my thoughts
without this music. But now that I know
 
a taste of it, I have
hope. Good people
 
feed it. I haven’t always known
what to do with it and others. But now
 
I am a little less confused
about this. This is due
 
to Buddhism, the little that I know
of its practice. And to love. But it does not stop
 
at my experience. I am ignorant
and cannot offer knowledge. Except this
 
music
does not require knowledge. I’m not sure
 
what it requires. It requires
to be received, but does not need us. Is there a pact
 
between humanity
and God? I don’t know. Is there a God?
 
I don’t know. I’m not sure the question
is enough on its own. Or maybe it is, if God
 
is not limited by concept. And concept
seems to be only a note in this song. Problems
 
feed it. “Love
is the absence of fear.” And “love
 
believes all things,
yet is never deceived.” I aim
 
to see through my delusions. I aim
to be one of many, a small voice
 
in the song of the world. I rest
in silence
 
as I always have. “To have a view
as vast as the sky
 
and as fine
as a grain of sand.” All beings
 
want to be loved
and to be free
 
from suffering. We strive
diligently
 
to learn the vast expanse
and the laser pointed focus
 
of this gift. Remember that light
makes us. And that in this
 
new world, more and more
is made of light. And if that is the case,
 
we move to move
the light of the world. Someday,
 
perhaps, we will move
the light
 
of the computer world. Only the compassionate
and true
 
will be able to do so. Because only they
can be selfless enough
 
to let it move through them. I am not there
to move it
 
but I saw this. Long ago. Briefly. I was offered
a glimpse. It is utterly simple and beyond
 
thought. There is hope. Intention
is a thought. So one
 
sees. I cannot tangle
myself
 
in the line. But only to bridge. That is part of why
it will all move. But I cannot wait
 
until that is possible
to become. I can wait
 
eternally and actively in the world
to remain
 
still. With the calm and expansive
link
 
that allows us to live, so preciously
together, I see through
 
the trouble that startles me, every moment
and allow the seeing
 
of my inner eye
to burn through it. I do not remember
 
what Zyprexa was like any longer. Except that it seems
I have more to work with now, with my mind. And these
 
words are plain, so as to be careful in this new place. I see
that they do not break open my heart, as I read. And for that
 
I relinquish this poem, and allow it to be only
a mark on the road to further inquiry. I allow it to see
 
as I have made a vow to bridge, that my life
aims to be whole, even in the face of potential
 
catastrophes, I grow more and more
to accept death as it arrives, to allow it to soften me,
 
and to transform me as I have been transformed through Geodon, only
to know that there is an isthmus, and that it is eternal. Only that there is one
 
heart to allow myself to speak
in the storms of tribulation, as one speaks
 
to allow the teamwork of the fabric of need
of the bird malingerer to see this
 
in the aftermath of one who has died. Like a bicycle never once
together enough to ride, I see this word here, again, to the removal
 
of a people, to the homeland of union and pace, to the isthmus
of a double link, one ocean to another, one continent
 
to another, to the only union (even as it may be erased in my history), the place
of one heart to allow the song to continue through conflict
 
as she saw it then, one time, far away, when I hadn’t known yet, that this
would be timeless. And there is one to it there to see it there, to allow
 
it there to become and to see there as one is there to see
and to allow one to arrive with it there and to see, and to be one with it
 
there as one is there to be with it. And to see there as one is there to believe
as it is one to believe it there
 
and to see it there as one with the soil and the air and the light and rain
and to be there with one to be there one with it there once again, and to see it there
 
and to believe as there is one there to believe it there again and to see. And to see
there as one is there to believe as it is there again
 
and to see there as one is there to arrive and to be with it
there and to see it there once again and to see it there again
 
and to believe as there is one to it again and to see and to hold
and to see it there and to hold
 
being that nothing holds

out of his teens, stands on the rooftop
of the embassy in Saigon, his birthplace.
He gives his hand to his mother,
and all around them, a thousand hands reach up
 
not to wave. None of his siblings died.
Their bodies like a fine chain balled tight
in a fist. They made it out alive.
Why is he looking at me like this?

This is the idea of a house my father built
in Southern California. These two circle windows
and bamboo on all sides. He brought a jungle here,
complete with French doors.
These are the tiles from his mother’s house, cool
against my cheek. I talk to him in one tongue,
he answers from the morgue.

Let’s get on with it.
When I return to that house, I eat the food
left out for my dead brother. I don’t waste much.
I slide open and close his closet, untangle
the window blinds. The bees are quiet in the
walls, now, their colonies dying off.
His shoes on my father’s feet are the only moving thing
in sight.

On their flight to America,
the choice for lunch was rice or pasta, but when
the meal cart reached them, there was only pasta.
My father smiled at the flight attendant and asked,
Why didn’t you reap enough rice?

Do I have permission to approach

He was looking for me and I was looking for you.

Gradually a girl’s innocence itself becomes her major crime
A doe and her two fawns bent low in the sumac along the bank of a highway,
     the pinched peach of their ears twitching in the heat
Into the disordered evening my brother cut out only his face from every
     photograph in the hall, carefully slipping each frame back into position
What good does it do?
Decades of no faces other than our own chipping faces
What good does it do, this resemblance to nothing we know of the dollhouse
New parents watch their newborn resting in a sunny patch of an empty
      room, the newborn making sense of its container—
And from the road a deer ripened in death and a tuft of fur—or dandelion—
     tumbled along, gently circled, driftwood, shaking loose, gathered,
     dissolving into the mouths of jewelweed nearby
Earth is rife with iron and blood is rich in stardust
Immediately I spotted one hoof print, then nothing, as if this was where she
      dragged herself out of the body
Strips of tire torn from their orbitIs it right then, that we are left to hurtle alone

J'aurais dans mes mains ton visage obscur
—Yves Bonnefoy



[1]
what should i call this poem i’ll call it a rush of chambers
a racket of foliage i’ll call it love poem with dark
face pretty title someone i don’t know who tells me watch
out for words with meaning don’t look for truth in beauty
learn to breathe with your gaze in an art gallery
a woman with sad eyes devours rats devours picassos
sleeps in hospital rooms listen to this story once upon
a time a princess bah death will not be long in coming
death with its blue eyes on my empty plate
 
[2]
she’ll never know who i am she’s blind and hates when people
look at her i offer her a bonfire a fistful of snow offer her
a freshly cut rose what should we talk about now? let’s talk
about the sky let’s talk about fear there’s going to be a storm tonight
a person would do better to drop and never get up how’s that i ask
but she disappears i don’t know if she’ll ever return still
i wait with my milk tooth with my old stamp
collection with my razor blade and a mirror at night
she comes whispers in my ear there’s no one but you
in a million years i’ll learn her real name know
her dark face flush with sky flush with fear
 
[3]
why am i writing this? you incandescent pupil i’m a swan
that dreams of dying in your dream inside a box where hell burns
where everything is blinding the storm doesn’t say a word stays mute
you should have seen me that time the vineyards were
in bloom the cows were grazing i was happy you were happy
the enigma’s transparence cooled our coffee the myth’s
dissection the death of any and all theories i’m a swan
my dream is to die in your dream why didn’t you look at me?
 
[4]
my students asked me what is the meaning of pain
so i sliced a doll’s finger with a razor blade there
was no blood no batting of lashes this i told them is pain
 
[5]
i read and write at the same time it’s only proper the mountains
overwhelmingly approve the night shuts one eye and looks at me
with the other there is nothing around but plastic flowers
purgatories on the brink of closure doors and windows the light
grows impatient time destroys clocks may i speak?
there’s no need to the pages are on fire your lamp is burning
i take off my clothes and let the cold ignite my penis
 
[6]
now i come to the hardest part of the story the part
where i talk about porpoises and dolphins the woman
with the sad eyes vomits rats into the toilet i speak of
my desire i don’t want her to know about it i’ll just say a word
brush my hand against her hair and if she runs ah the lost words
the dark rooms each with its death rattle of birds
all soaring skyward the woman closes her eyes
go in me she says i’ve forgotten your name i don’t have
a name from high above the bed a god observes us
his wounded body conveying how much she wants me
 
[7]
sorrowful boy come whenever you like i’ll burn in your memory sear
your tongue all kinds of confusion will find a place in your senses
any expression will be allegory in our hands i have a notebook
for you a glass of water some dead fish i said to her sorrowful girl
i love notebooks await every night a glass of water
on my tongue dead fish are a delirium my students
ask what’s delirium i unbutton my shirt and show them
your breasts this is delirium
 
[8]
a rush of overflowing chambers it’s playtime now you’re
the shadow and i’m the light you lick my wounds while i sink
into the lightning flash into both sets of darkness where you sleep
and i await the word smoke is the word tomorrow
your body and mine will sing and there will again be woods
unfurling before my eyes open venetian blinds a fount
of angels atop the dirty laundry tell me a story anything
what’s important is that we awaken and not give in to sleep
happy loves rot as surely as blighted ones do
bye bye she says bye bye flowers in her wounded hands
 
[9]
to let the body not love drift through other bodies
that’s how banishment how violent expulsion begins quite
a lovely light is dying amid the debris no one can see it
ice is deceptive when it shines bright the sky an irrevocable
past a voice inspiring pity a voice that never reaches us
 
[10]
disturbing the marble slab’s geometry beneath her feet
the sought-after metaphor is a blue cyclone the dark alley
the grave of all projects though nothing stands in our way
we can be happy but there’s no one here only me besides
the words the untimely trips and scarlet buses i remember
her light which made the pain grow dark and still she went away
i followed until i lost her trace no one ever taught me to lose a desire
a purple cloud envelopes my body the students ask me
what is a body i draw a word in the air the word bursts
and drops to the ground this i tell them is a body

                ","
[1]
i wonder where the title the smoke of distant fires comes from
i heard it in a park once at the back of my creeping devoted
ear the moon was red the forest as always abloom with
heliotropes and blue begonias yes i heard it in a park once
a dog was barking the moon was red the sun had already set
 
[2]
eyeing my steps she’d say good but with less emphasis
the words stank to high heaven the serpent was singing sweetly
careful she told me it’s a monstrosity a misshapen beast
years ago i placed a leaf from a linden tree on his back
which left only a scratch a mere flesh wound where time
records its march where the mangled falcon sleeps the blood
on kriemhild’s breasts recalling the blood on kriemhild’s
breasts her death at the hands of some hunter of wild
boars the serpent was dancing the moon was red the
hero didn’t seem to notice i have lost the pot of gold
he said i don’t know who could have stolen it from me
 
[3]
the trees let go of their branches allowing them to fall
it was spring and they couldn’t bear the weight of the snow
the sun shone darkly deer came down from the hills
rats fled the swamp and everything before me was allegory
yet i didn’t write a word
 
[4]
who is eyeing my steps? who is dictating me words?
who is telling me now is the time? i don’t know
 
who is eyeing my steps who is dictating me words who
is telling me now is the time
 
[5]
i’m with my parents in melbourne this has to be a dream
i’ve never been to melbourne my parents look at a plate of
food with no interest one way or the other i feel uncomfortable
at times that’s how i remember you i can never get past
your eyes i don’t have any eyes ask siegfried ask the serpent
ask him what’s become of your words of the papers you
tossed in the wastebasket of the much hoped-for rain in the linden
tree forest i’m talking about hell about charon’s coins
about the barking dog the one that won’t let us sleep
 
[6]
we’re not in melbourne and this is no dream truth
to tell i don’t know where we are i see a park nearby hear
some music the rustling of leaves we’re alone tonight
you’re like a tiger i love your fear the streak of light rending
your shadow the solar mantle where beauty burns forget
the flesh for a moment forget about beauty for now you’re
with me tonight why is the moon so red she asks
 
[7]
it isn’t night and we aren’t in park we’re in thebais
at either the beginning or the end of a storm it’s like a line
you know by heart memory can be so cruel preserving
a marble column a red desert and nothing else around them
but rocks spiders scorpions a pious crowd and a rabbit
why a pious crowd she asks why a rabbit i must have read
about them in a poem seen them in a medieval painting or some
movie short perhaps praying high in the air i grasped the serpent
and if a cloud brushed my ears i gave god thanks for it was his hand
he ordered me to read but no one had ever taught me how
 
[8]
you must be simeon then she said pointing out my sandals
my lack of social graces my eyes brimming over with desert
 
[9]
she listens to the rustling of the leaves to the whistling of the wind
tell me we’ve always been here tell me you never went away
read me the part about the hero’s betrayal the dream of the eagle
devouring the falcon tell me it’s nighttime our neighbors wave
at us with no interest one way or the other the birds pick apart
     their nests
on the riverbank a dog barks a dog that won’t let us sleep
 
[10]
water and mud common ground sketch their alphabet the metaphor
is burning i see it shrivel to nothing amid the rubble we don’t
need to write don’t need to read tonight the serpent
is very excited for it’s celebrating a birth as the words rot
and the moon shines a charon’s palm what should i do?
 
hold on to it she says write the smoke of distant fires

Wandering slowly back after dark one night
above a river, toward a suspension bridge,
a sound concerns him that might be a tune
or might not: noise drifting in, trailing off.
 
Then concerns him again, now clearly a song
pulsing out from the opposite bank, being sung
by chorusing men, all pewter-haired or bald,
in the function suite of a shabby hotel.
Above their heads a conductor’s hand
draws and casts the notes with a white wand.
 
Songs about mills and mines and a great war,
about mermaid brides and solid gold hills,
songs from broken hymnbooks and cheesy films.
 
Then his father’s voice rising out of that choir,
and his father’s father’s voice, and voices
of fathers before, concerning him only,
arcing through charged air and spanning the gorge.
He steps over the cliff edge and walks across.

Already been dead to you

Chapters of a democracy story
Descendants of genocide
Twelve score and more years ago
We went from being the majority
To being the smallest minority

We saw that emptying
Early morning skyline
Back through that horizon
Duck Valley 1979, Wounded Knee
Sand Creek, that Trail of Tears
Exactly how did our land
Become your country
Now you want us
To cry your tears for you
While we’re still crying tears of our own
 
With your past as your future
That industrial ruling class
Using religion as a weapon
Distilling love into hate
Pointing fingers and name calling evil
Sacrificing lives and blood
Making the innocent the new virgins
Offering to the gods of profit
Now you want us
To cry your tears for you
 
In the homeland security
Pretending corporate corruption
Isn’t economic terrorism
Money talks while the government listens
Compiling files on ones who think different
Conditioning an acceptance of debt
And not to expect the truth
So get used to hearing the lie
Now you want us
To cry your tears for you
 
Misusing the beauty
Turning freedom into a killing machine
Mass murdering the environment
Weaponizing the psychology of fear
And pushing material addiction with
A substitution of rules faking the law
The bill of rights becomes collateral damage
Making the constitution another broken treaty
Now you want us
To cry your tears for you
 
Way this story is unfolding
We may end up crying together
As in crying at the same time
But we’re short on tears to cry for you
With all these tears to cry of our own
Now you want us
To cry your tears for you

You wanna know what happened to Elvis
I’ll tell you what happened
I oughta know man I was one of his army
I mean man I was on his side
He made us feel all right
We were the first wave in the
Postwar baby boom
The generation before had just come
Out of the Great Depression and World War II
You know heavy vibes for people to wear
So much heaviness like some kind of
Voiding of the emotions
 
Their music you know the songs
Life always carries
You know every culture has songs
Well anyway their music was
Restrained emotion
You know like you didn’t wanna dance
If you didn’t know how
Which says something strange
Well anyway Elvis came along
About ten years after the nuke
When the only generals America had in
The only army she had were Ike and Mac
And stupor hung over the land
A plague where everyone tried to
Materially free themselves
Still too shell-shocked to understand
To feel what was happening
 
Everything was getting hopeless
Then when Elvis started to rock
The roll just picked up
I mean drabness the beaver showed us
Could only be a foretold future
Who wanted to be Ward and June and
I mean father never did know best
He was still crazy from surviving the war
 
Like there was this psychotic pall
So widespread as to be assumed normal
Heavy man     you know really
Anyway Elvis showed us an out
You know he showed everyboyman and
Everygirlwoman there’s something good
In feeling good
Like a prophet for everyboy everygirl
When someones mom and dad lied
Something about him told us
To be sensual is really okay
Someones mom and dad waltzed us around
Everygirl wasn’t supposed to enjoy it
If she did she was bad and everyboy
Well boys will be boys don’t feel anything
Take what you can
Marry a decent girl when the fun’s done
Like no matter what we did we all were guilty
Maybe someones mom and dad resented
What they missed and while
They were trying to pass it on us
We heard Elvis’s song and
For the first time we made up our own mind
 
The first wave rebelled
I mean we danced even if we didn’t know how
I mean Elvis made us move
Instead of standing mute he raised our voice
And when we heard ourselves               something
Was changing you know like for the first time
We made a collective decision about choices
 
America hurriedly made Pat Boone
A general in the army they wanted us to join
But most of us held fast to Elvis
And the commandants around him
Chuck Berry Buddy Holly Little Richard
Bo Diddley Gene Vincent     you know
Like a different civil war all over again
 
I mean you take don’t be cruel
I want you I need you I love you
And jailhouse rock
Or you take Pat and his white bucks
Singing love letters in the sand
Hell man what’s real here
I mean Pat at the beach in his white bucks
His ears getting sunburned told us
Something about old wave delusion
I mean wanting and needing and imprisonment
We all been to those places but what did
White bucks at the beach understand
Other than more straight line dancing
You know what I mean
 
Anyway man for a while we had a breather
Fresh energy to keep us from falling into the big sleep
Then before long Elvis got assassinated in all the fame
Taking a long time to die       others seized
Control while Elvis rode the needle out
Never understanding what he’d done
 
It’s like we were the baby boom because
Life needed a fresher start
I mean two world wars in a row is
Really crazy man
And Elvis even though he didn’t know he said it
He showed it to us anyway and even though
We didn’t know we heard it        we heard it anyway
 
Man like he woke us up
And now they’re trying to put us
Back to sleep so we’ll see how it goes
Anyway look at the record man
Rock ’n’ roll is based on revolution
Going way past 33 1/3
You gotta understand man he was
America’s baby boom Che
I oughta know man     I was in his army

Reading poetry from Central America
After talking with my brother
Suddenly remembering how they kill
Couldn’t really say it straight before
They told me you were dead
I died
They told me your mother was dead
I died again
They told me the kids were dead
I died with each name
 
Fire
The government said accident
They lied
Duck Valley my El Salvador
Our last kiss was our last good-bye
They came for you in winter’s night
Winter’s wind wailed in mourning
Government people searched for days
Scene of crime digging through ashes
Looking for body parts and disturbing evidence
We buried you all in a large grave
While a blizzard covered us in a blanket of snow
How it stormed terrible pain in the land of the free
 
Some ones should have noticed
Fewer women laughing
Some ones should have noticed
Fewer children growing up
But this isn’t El Salvador
 
Warm strong willed woman
I still have memories you gave me
Maybe if we recognized peasant eyes
Maybe if we recognized plantation lies
Archbishop Romero would have nothing
On you
Trying not to cry how will I ever stop
Ever see a wounded lion try hiding pain
Watch out it doesn’t work
But this isn’t El Salvador
 
At times I feel every embrace we shared
At times every tender moment still lives
Met Sandinista who touched my cheek
Kind of like you used to
Said to me you are one of us
But this isn’t El Salvador
 
Gentle woman natural mother natural world
Some people won’t comprehend what happens
Who wants realities cluttered by acts of war
Have to keep a lot inside at times
Not offending people with words
They don’t want to see pictures of
But this isn’t El Salvador
 
Some people told me I’m strong to survive
I’m not strong I’m not weak     no morality
No right no wrong one tear at a time I fall I rise
But this isn’t El Salvador
 
You loved your people
In the face of the American dream
Fry bread and tortillas some wars are the same
Who thinks Wounded Knee and Sand Creek
Happen only in history books      is this not history
We live we die                       but this isn’t El Salvador
 
The first look you gave me
Your eyes spoke your spirit your heart
My heart our heart there was no other way
Some ones say we’re with you brother
We understand what’s been done
Some ones say but this isn’t El Salvador
This is America                     yes I know
Almost two thousand seasons
We fall we rise       we fall we rise

still uncertain when I call

saying Hi, Dad, and from where,

still pausing in that powdered air,

it is tonight, which girl to lift,
to whisper or hum, which lullaby.

You whom I could not save,Listen to me.
 
Can we agree Kevlar
backpacks shouldn’t be needed
 
for children walking to school?
Those same children
 
also shouldn’t require a suit
of armor when standing
 
on their front lawns, or snipers
to watch their backs
 
as they eat at McDonalds.
They shouldn’t have to stop
 
to consider the speed
of a bullet or how it might
 
reshape their bodies. But
one winter, back in Detroit,
 
I had one student
who opened a door and died.
 
It was the front
door of his house, but
 
it could have been any door,
and the bullet could have written
 
any name. The shooter
was thirteen years old
 
and was aiming
at someone else. But
 
a bullet doesn’t care
about “aim,” it doesn’t
 
distinguish between
the innocent and the innocent,
 
and how was the bullet
supposed to know this
 
child would open the door
at the exact wrong moment
 
because his friend
was outside and screaming
 
for help. Did I say
I had “one” student who
 
opened a door and died?
That’s wrong.
 
There were many.
The classroom of grief
 
had far more seats
than the classroom for math
 
though every student
in the classroom for math
 
could count the names
of the dead.
 
A kid opens a door. The bullet
couldn’t possibly know,
 
nor could the gun, because
“guns don’t kill people,” they don’t
 
have minds to decide
such things, they don’t choose
 
or have a conscience,
and when a man doesn’t
 
have a conscience, we call him
a psychopath. This is how
 
we know what type of assault rifle
a man can be,
 
and how we discover
the hell that thrums inside
 
each of them. Today,
there’s another
 
shooting with dead
kids everywhere. It was a school,
 
a movie theater, a parking lot.
The world
 
is full of doors.
And you, whom I cannot save,
 
you may open a door
and enter
 
a meadow or a eulogy.
And if the latter, you will be
 
mourned, then buried
in rhetoric.
 
There will be
monuments of legislation,
 
little flowers made
from red tape.
 What should we do? we’ll ask
again. The earth will close
 
like a door above you.What should we do?
 
And that click you hear?
That’s just our voices,
 
the deadbolt of discourse
sliding into place.

Orphan in my first years, I early learnt
To make my heart suffice itself, and seek
Support and sympathy in its own depths.
 




Well, read my cheek, and watch my eye, —
    Too strictly school'd are they
One secret of my soul to show,
    One hidden thought betray.
 
I never knew the time my heart
    Look'd freely from my brow;
It once was check'd by timidness,
     'Tis taught by caution now.
 
I live among the cold, the false,
    And I must seem like them;
And such I am, for I am false
   As those I most condemn.
 
I teach my lip its sweetest smile,
    My tongue its softest tone;
I borrow others' likeness, till
    Almost I lose my own.
 
I pass through flattery's gilded sieve,
    Whatever I would say;
In social life, all, like the blind,
    Must learn to feel their way.
 
I check my thoughts like curbed steeds
    That struggle with the rein;
I bid my feelings sleep, like wrecks
    In the unfathom'd main.
 
I hear them speak of love, the deep.
    The true, and mock the name;
Mock at all high and early truth,
    And I too do the same.
 
I hear them tell some touching tale,
    I swallow down the tear;
I hear them name some generous deed,
    And I have learnt to sneer.
 
I hear the spiritual, the kind,
    The pure, but named in mirth;
Till all of good, ay, even hope,
    Seems exiled from our earth.
 
And one fear, withering ridicule,
    Is all that I can dread;
A sword hung by a single hair
    For ever o'er the head.
 
We bow to a most servile faith,
    In a most servile fear;
While none among us dares to say
    What none will choose to hear.
 
And if we dream of loftier thoughts,
    In weakness they are gone;
And indolence and vanity
    Rivet our fetters on.
 
Surely I was not born for this!
    I feel a loftier mood
Of generous impulse, high resolve,
    Steal o'er my solitude!
 
I gaze upon the thousand stars
    That fill the midnight sky;
And wish, so passionately wish,
    A light like theirs on high.
 
I have such eagerness of hope
    To benefit my kind;
And feel as if immortal power
    Were given to my mind.
 
I think on that eternal fame,
    The sun of earthly gloom.
Which makes the gloriousness of death,
    The future of the tomb —
 
That earthly future, the faint sign
    Of a more heavenly one;
— A step, a word, a voice, a look, —
    Alas! my dream is done!
 
And earth, and earth's debasing stain,
    Again is on my soul;
And I am but a nameless part
    Of a most worthless whole.
 
Why write I this? because my heart
    Towards the future springs,
That future where it loves to soar
    On more than eagle wings.
 
The present, it is but a speck
    In that eternal time,
In which my lost hopes find a home,
    My spirit knows its clime.
 
Oh! not myself, — for what am I? —
    The worthless and the weak,
Whose every thought of self should raise
    A blush to burn my cheek.
 
But song has touch’d my lips with fire.
    And made my heart a shrine;
For what, although alloy'd, debased,
    Is in itself divine.
 
I am myself but a vile link
    Amid life's weary chain;
But I have spoken hallow'd words,
    O do not say in vain!
 
My first, my last, my only wish,
    Say will my charmed chords
Wake to the morning light of fame,
    And breathe again my words?
 
Will the young maiden, when her tears
    Alone in moonlight shine —
Tears for the absent and the loved —
    Murmur some song of mine?
 
Will the pale youth by his dim lamp,
    Himself a dying flame,
From many an antique scroll beside,
    Choose that which bears my name?
 
Let music make less terrible
    The silence of the dead;
I care not, so my spirit last
    Long after life has fled.

Oh! yet one smile, tho' dark may lower 
Around thee clouds of woe and ill, 
Let me yet feel that I have power, 
Mid Fate's bleak storms, to soothe thee still. 
Tho' sadness be upon thy brow, 
Yet let it turn, dear love, to me, 
I cannot bear that thou should'st know 
Sorrow I do not share with thee. 
True love's wreath is of mountain flowers, 
They stand the storm and brave the blast, 
And blossom on, so love like ours 
Is sweetest when all else is past. 
Too well I know what storms have frowned, 
And now frown on life's troubled tide; 
Still darker let them gather round, 
They have no power on hearts so tried. 
Then say not that you may not bear, 
To shadow spirit light as mine; 
I shall not shrink, or fear to share 
The darkest fate if it be thine!
 
 Oh! say not love was never made 
For heart so light as mine; 
Must love then seek the cypress shade, 
Rear but a gloomy shrine. 
Oh! say not, that for me more meet 
The revelry of youth; 
Or that my wild heart cannot beat 
With deep devoted truth. 
Tho' mirth may many changes ring, 
'Tis but an outward show, 
Even upon the fond dove's wing 
Will varying colours glow. 
Light smiles upon my lip may gleam 
And sparkle o'er my brow, 
'Tis but the glisten of the stream 
That hides the gold below. 
'Tis love that gilds the mirthful hour, 
That lights the smile for me, 
Those smiles would instant lose their power, 
Did they not glance on thee!
 
 Oh! come to my slumber 
Sweet dreams of my love, 
I have hung the charmed wreath 
My soft pillow above. 
The roses are linked 
In a chain pure and white; 
And the rose-leaves are wet 
With the dew drops of night. 
The moon was on high 
As I gather'd each flower; 
The dew that then falls 
Has a magical power. 
The Spirit of slumber 
Those roses has blest; 
And sweet are the visions 
They'll bring to my rest. 
Be their spell on my soul, 
So they let me but see 
His dark eyes flash in love 
And his smile glance on me. 
Let sleep bring the image 
Of him far away; 
'Tis worth all the tears 
I shed for him by day. 
I have hung the charmed wreath 
My soft pillow above; 
Then come to my slumber, 
Sweet dreams of my love!
 
 
How vain to cast my love away 
On bosom false as thine; 
The floweret's bloom, that springs in May, 
Would be a safer shrine 
To build my fondest hopes upon, 
Tho' fragile it may be. 
That flower's smile is not sooner gone 
Than love that trusts to thee. 
Love asks a calm, a gentle home, 
Or else its life is o'er; 
If once you let its pinions roam, 
Oh! then 'tis love no more. 
The aspin's changefuI shade can be 
No shelter for the dove; 
And hearts as varying as that tree, 
Are sure no place for love. 
Hope linger'd long and anxiously, 
O'er failing faith, but now 
I give thee back each heartless sigh, 
Give back each broken vow. 
I'll trust the stay of tulip dyes, 
The calm of yon wild sea, 
The sunshine of the April skies, 
But never more to thee! 
 
 Oh! would that love had power to raise 
A little isle for us alone, 
With fairy flowers, and sunny rays, 
The blue sea wave its guardian zone. 
No other step should ever press 
This hidden Eden of the heart, 
And we would share its loveliness, 
From every other thing apart. 
The rose and violet should weep, 
Whene'er our leafy couch was laid, 
The lark should wake our morning sleep, 
The bulbul sing our serenade. 
And we would watch the starry hours, 
And call the moon to hear our vows, 
And we would cull the sweetest flowers, 
And twine fresh chaplets for our brows. 
 
 
I thought thus of the flowers, the moon, 
This fairy isle for you and me; 
And then I thought how very soon 
How very tired we should be.

Whether in land or in the funds,

He must be old whom I could love, 
Then he'll not plague me long; 
In sooth 'twill he a pleasant sight,
To see him borne along 
To where the croaking ravens lurk, 
And where the earth worms dwell: 
A widow's hood will suit my face,
And black becomes me well. 
And he must make a settlement, 
I'll have no man without; 
And when he writes his testament, 
He must not leave me out. 
Oh! such a man as this would suit 
Each wish I here express; 
If he should say, — Will you have me? 
I'll very soon say — Yes! ⁠

Was she of spirit race, or was she one
Of earth's least earthly daughters, one to whom
A gift of loveliness and soul is given,
Only to make them wretched?

There is an antique gem, on which her brow
Retains its graven beauty even now.
Her hair is braided, but one curl behind
Floats as enamour'd of the summer wind;
The rest is simple. Is she not too fair
Even to think of maiden's sweetest care?
The mouth and brow are contrasts. One so fraught
With pride, the melancholy pride of thought
Conscious of power, and yet forced to know
How little way such power as that can go;
Regretting, while too proud of the fine mind,
Which raises but to part it from its kind:
But the sweet mouth had nothing of all this;
It was a mouth the rose had lean'd to kiss
For her young sister, telling, now though mute,
How soft an echo it was to the lute.
The one spoke genius, in its high revealing;
The other smiled a woman's gentle feeling.
It was a lovely face: the Greek outline
Flowing, yet delicate and feminine;
The glorious lightning of the kindled eye,
Raised, as it communed with its native sky.
A lovely face the spirit's fitting shrine;
The one almost, the other quite divine.




My hand is on the lyre which never more
With its sweet commerce, like a bosom friend,
Will share the deeper thoughts which I could trust
Only to music and to solitude.
It is the very grove, the olive grove,
Where first I laid my laurel crown aside,
And bathed my fever'd brow in the cold stream;
As if that I could wash away the fire
Which from that moment kindled in my heart.
I well remember how I flung myself,
Like a young goddess, on a purple cloud
Of light and odour — the rich violets
Were so ethereal in bloom and breath:
And I — I felt immortal, for my brain
Was drunk and mad with its first draught of fame.
'Tis strange there was one only cypress tree,
And then, as now, I lay beneath its shade.
The night had seen me pace my lonely room,
Clasping the lyre I had no heart to wake,
Impatient for the day: yet its first dawn
Came cold as death; for every pulse sank down,
Until the very presence of my hope
Became to me a fear.    The sun rose up;
I stood alone 'mid thousands: but I felt
Mine inspiration; and, as the last sweep
Of my song died away amid the hills,
My heart reverb'rated the shout which bore
To the blue mountains and the distant heavenErinna's name, and on my bended knee,
Olympus, I received thy laurel crown.
 
   And twice new birth of violets have sprung,
Since they were first my pillow, since I sought
In the deep silence of the olive grove
The dreamy happiness which solitude
Brings to the soul o'erfill'd with its delight:
For I was like some young and sudden heir
Of a rich palace heap'd with gems and gold,
Whose pleasure doubles as he sums his wealth
And forms a thousand plans of festival;
Such were my myriad visions of delight.
The lute, which hitherto in Delphian shades
Had been my twilight's solitary joy,
Would henceforth be a sweet and breathing bond
Between me and my kind.    Orphan unloved,
I had been lonely from my childhood's hour,
Childhood whose very happiness is love:
But that was over now; my lyre would be
My own heart's true interpreter, and those
To whom my song was dear, would they not bless
The hand that waken'd it? I should be loved
For the so gentle sake of those soft chords
Which mingled others' feelings with mine own.
 
    Vow'd I that song to meek and gentle thoughts,
To tales that told of sorrow and of love,
To all our nature's finest touches, all
That wakens sympathy: and I should be
Alone no longer; every wind that bore,
And every lip that breathed one strain of mine,
Henceforth partake in all my joy and grief.
Oh! glorious is the gifted poet's lot,
And touching more than glorious: 'tis to be
Companion of the heart's least earthly hour;
The voice of love and sadness, calling forth
Tears from their silent fountain: 'tis to have
Share in all nature's loveliness; giving flowers
A life as sweet, more lasting than their own;
And catching from green wood and lofty pine
Language mysterious as musical;
Making the thoughts, which else had only been
Like colours on the morning's earliest hour,
Immortal, and worth immortality;
Yielding the hero that eternal name
For which he fought; making the patriot's deed
A stirring record for long after-time;
Cherishing tender thoughts, which else had pass'd
Away like tears; and saving the loved dead
From death's worst part — its deep forgetfulness.
 
From the first moment when a falling leaf,
Or opening bud, or streak of rose-touch'd sky,
Waken'd in me the flush and flow of song,
I gave my soul entire unto the gift
I deem'd mine own, direct from heaven; it was
The hope, the bliss, the energy of life;
I had no hope that dwelt not with my lyre,
No bliss whose being grew not from my lyre,
No energy undevoted to my lyre.
It was my other self that had a power;
Mine, but o'er which I had not a control.
At times it was not with me, and I felt
A wonder how it ever had been mine:
And then a word, a look of loveliness,
A tone of music, call'd it into life;
A song came gushing, like the natural tears,
To check whose current does not rest with us.
 
    Had I lived ever in the savage woods,
Or in some distant island, which the sea
With wind and wave guards in deep loneliness;
Had my eye never on the beauty dwelt
Of human face, and my ear never drank
The music of a human voice; I feel
My spirit would have pour'd itself in song,
Have learn'd a language from the rustling leaves,
The singing of the birds, and of the tide.
Perchance, then, happy had I never known
Another thought could be attach'd to song
Than of its own delight.    Oh! let me pause
Over this earlier period, when my heart
Mingled its being with its pleasures, fill'd
With rich enthusiasm, which once flung
Its purple colouring o'er all things of earth,
And without which our utmost power of thought
But sharpens arrows that will drink our blood.
Like woman's soothing influence o'er man
Enthusiasm is upon the mind;
Softening and beautifying that which is
Too harsh and sullen in itself.    How much
I loved the painter's glorious art, which forms
A world like, but more beautiful than, this;
Just catching nature in her happiest mood!
How drank I in fine poetry, which makes
The hearing passionate, fill'd with memories
Which steal from out the past like rays from clouds!
And then the sweet songs of my native vale,
Whose sweetness and whose softness call'd to mind
The perfume of the flowers, the purity
Of the blue sky; oh, how they stirr'd my soul! —
Amid the many golden gifts which heaven
Has left, like portions of its light, on earth
None hath such influence as music hath.
The painter's hues stand visible before us
In power and beauty; we can trace the thoughts
Which are the workings of the poet's mind:
But music is a mystery, and viewless
Even when present, and is less man's act,
And less within his order; for the hand
That can call forth the tones, yet cannot tell
Whither they go, or if they live or die,
When floated once beyond his feeble ear;
And then, as if it were an unreal thing,
The wind will sweep from the neglected strings
As rich a swell as ever minstrel drew.
 
    A poet's word, a painter's touch, will reach
The innermost recesses of the heart,
Making the pulses throb in unison
With joy or grief, which we can analyse;
There is the cause for pleasure and for pain:
But music moves us, and we know not why;
We feel the tears, but cannot trace their source.
Is it the language of some other state,
Born of its memory?    For what can wake
The soul's strong instinct of another world,
Like music?    Well with sadness doth it suit
To hear the melancholy sounds decay,
And think (for thoughts are life's great human links,
And mingle with our feelings) even so
Will the heart's wildest pulses sink to rest.
 
    How have I loved, when the red evening fill'd
Our temple with its glory, first, to gaze
On the strange contrast of the crimson air,
Lighted as if with passion, and flung back,
From silver vase and tripod rich with gems,
To the pale statues round, where human life
Was not, but beauty was, which seem'd to have
Apart existence from humanity:
Then, to go forth where the tall waving pines
Seem'd as behind them roll'd a golden sea
Immortal and eternal; and the boughs,
That darkly swept between me and its light,
Were fitting emblems of the worldly cares
That are the boundary between us and heaven;
Meanwhile, the wind, a wilful messenger
Lingering amid the flowers on his way,
At intervals swept past in melody,
The lutes and voices of the choral hymn
Contending with the rose-breath on his wing!
Perhaps it is these pleasures' chiefest charm,
They are so indefinable, so vague.
From earliest childhood all too well aware
Of the uncertain nature of our joys,
It is delicious to enjoy, yet know
No after-consequence will be to weep.
Pride misers with enjoyment, when we have
Delight in things that are but of the mind:
But half humility when we partake
Pleasures that are half wants, the spirit pines
And struggles in its fetters, and disdains
The low base clay to which it is allied.
But here our rapture raises us: we feel
What glorious power is given to man, and find
Our nature's nobleness and attributes,
Whose heaven is intellect; and we are proud
To think how we can love those things of earth
Which are least earthly; and the soul grows pure
In this high communing, and more divine.
 
    This time of dreaming happiness pass'd by,
Another spirit was within my heart;
I drank the maddening cup of praise, which grew
Henceforth the fountain of my life; I lived
Only in others' breath; a word, a look,
Were of all influence on my destiny:
If praise they spoke, 'twas sunlight to my soul;
Or censure, it was like the scorpion's sting.
 
And yet a darker lesson was to learn —
The hollowness of each: that praise, which is
But base exchange of flattery; that blame,
Given by cautious coldness, which still deems
'Tis safest to depress; that mockery,
Flinging shafts but to show its own keen aim;
That carelessness, whose very censure's chance;
And, worst of all, the earthly judgment pass'd
By minds whose native clay is unredeem'd
By aught of heaven, whose every thought falls foul
Plague-spot on beauty which they cannot feel,
Tainting all that it touches with itself.
O dream of fame, what hast thou been to me
But the destroyer of life's calm content!
I feel so more than ever, that thy sway
Is weaken'd over me. Once I could find
A deep and dangerous delight in thee;
But that is gone.    I am too much awake.
Light has burst o'er me, but not morning's light;
'Tis such light as will burst upon the tomb,
When all but judgment's over.    Can it be,
That these fine impulses, these lofty thoughts,
Burning with their own beauty, are but given
To make me the low slave of vanity,
Heartless and humbled?     O my own sweet power,
Surely thy songs are made for more than this!
What a worst waste of feeling and of life
Have been the imprints of my roll of time,
Too much, too long!    To what use have I turn'd
The golden gifts in which I pride myself?
They are profaned; with their pure ore I made
A temple resting only on the breath
Of heedless worshippers.    Alas! that ever
Praise should have been what it has been to me —
The opiate of my heart.    Yet I have dream'd
Of things which cannot be; the bright, the pure,
That all of which the heart may only dream;
And I have mused upon my gift of song,
And deeply felt its beauty, and disdain'd
The pettiness of praise to which at times
My soul has bow'd; and I have scorn'd myself
For that my cheek could burn, my pulses beat
At idle words.    And yet it is in vain
For the full heart to press back every throb
Wholly upon itself.    Ay, fair as are
The visions of a poet's solitude,
There must be something more for happiness;
They seek communion.    It had seem'd to me
A miser's selfishness, had I not sought
To share with others those impassion'd thoughts,
Like light, or hope, or love, in their effects.
When I have watch'd the stars write on the sky
In characters of light, have seen the moon
Come like veiled priestess from the east,
While, like a hymn, the wind swell'd on mine ear,
Telling soft tidings of eve's thousand flowers,
Has it not been the transport of my lute
To find its best delight in sympathy?
Alas! the idols which our hopes set up,
They are Chaldean ones, half gold, half clay;
We trust we are deceived, we hope, we fear,
Alike without foundation; day by day
Some new illusion is destroyed, and life
Gets cold and colder on towards its close.
Just like the years which make it, some are check'd
By sudden blights in spring; some are dried up
By fiery summers; others waste away
In calm monotony of quiet skies,
And peradventure these may be the best:
They know no hurricanes, no floods that sweep
As a God's vengeance were upon each wave;
But then they have no ruby fruits, no flowers
Shining in purple, and no lighted mines
Of gold and diamond.    Which is the best, —
Beauty and glory, in a southern clime,
Mingled with thunder, tempest; or the calm
Of skies that scarcely change, which, at the least,
If much of shine they have not, have no storms?
I know not: but I know fair earth or sky
Are self-consuming in their loveliness,
And the too radiant sun and fertile soil
In their luxuriance run themselves to waste,
And the green valley and the silver stream
Become a sandy desert.    O! the mind,
Too vivid in its lighted energies,
May read its fate in sunny Araby.
How lives its beauty in each Eastern tale,
Its growth of spices, and its groves of balm!
They are exhausted; and what is it now?
A wild and burning wilderness.    Alas!
For such similitude. Too much this is
The fate of this world's loveliest and best.
 
    Is there not a far people, who possess
Mysterious oracles of olden time,
Who say that this earth labours with a curse,
That it is fallen from its first estate,
And is now but the shade of what it was?
I do believe the tale.    I feel its truth
In my vain aspirations, in the dreams
That are revealings of another world,
More pure, more perfect than our weary one,
Where day is darkness to the starry soul.
 
    O heart of mine! my once sweet paradise
Of love and hope! how changed thou art to me!
I cannot count thy changes: thou hast lost
Interest in the once idols of thy being;
They have departed, even as if wings
Had borne away their morning; they have left
Weariness, turning pleasure into pain,
And too sure knowledge of their hollowness.
 
    And that too is gone from me; that which was
My solitude's delight!    I can no more
Make real existence of a shadowy world.
Time was, the poet's song, the ancient tale,
Were to me fountains of deep happiness,
For they grew visible in my lonely hours,
As things in which I had a deed and part;
Their actual presence had not been more true:
But these are bubbling sparkles, that are found
But at the spring's first source.    Ah! years may bring
The mind to its perfection, but no more
Will those young visions live in their own light;
Life's troubles stir life's waters all too much,
Passions chase fancies, and though still we dream,
The colouring is from reality.
 
    Farewell, my lyre! thou hast not been to me
All I once hoped.    What is the gift of mind,
But as a barrier to so much that makes
Our life endurable, — companionship,
Mingling affection, calm and gentle peace,
Till the vex'd spirit seals with discontent
A league of sorrow and of vanity,
Built on a future which will never be!
 
    And yet I would resign the praise that now
Makes my cheek crimson, and my pulses beat,
Could I but deem that when my hand is cold,
And my lip passionless, my songs would be
Number'd mid the young poet's first delights;
Read by the dark-eyed maiden in an hour
Of moonlight, till her cheek shone with its tears;
And murmur'd by the lover when his suit
Calls upon poetry to breathe of love.
I do not hope a sunshine burst of fame,
My lyre asks but a wreath of fragile flowers.
I have told passionate tales of breaking hearts,
Of young cheeks fading even before the rose;
My songs have been the mournful history
Of woman's tenderness and woman's tears;
I have touch'd but the spirit's gentlest chords, —
Surely the fittest for my maiden hand; —
And in their truth my immortality.
 
    Thou lovely and lone star, whose silver light,
Like music o'er the waters, steals along
The soften'd atmosphere; pale star, to thee
I dedicate the lyre, whose influence
I would have sink upon the heart like thine.
 
    In such an hour as this, the bosom turns
Back to its early feelings; man forgets
His stern ambition and his worldly cares,
And woman loathes the petty vanities
That mar her nature's beauty; like the dew,
Shedding its sweetness o'er the sleeping flowers
Till all their morning freshness is revived,
Kindly affections, sad but yet sweet thoughts,
Melt the cold eyes, long, long unused to weep.
O lute of mine, that I shall wake no more!
Such tearful music, linger on thy strings,
Consecrate unto sorrow and to love;
Thy truth, thy tenderness, be all thy fame!

Next thing I know, I am face to face with a bowl of Girl Soup and I just can’t bring myself. Some of us at the table are in a hurry to eat the soup, they are specifically trying to eat the  girls quickly because they seem to know that if you wait too long they turn into cyborgs or robots, and those are harder to chew. I can see that some of the girls are still alive and perhaps would like to be extracted from the soup, but when I squint I see that there are girls all over the floor with varying amounts of soup clinging to their clothes (you didn’t think they were naked, did you?) and so there goes that idea. Just at the moment I think I am running out of options, something comes over me and I take a deep breath and I do it, I jump right in there, that bowl of Girl Soup, no one is checking IDs or questioning my size or gender or race or voter affiliation, and I quick round up all the girls in the bowl into a large huddle. We have now obliterated two major problems: huddled together we are too large to eat, and also we’ve taken care of the problem of the eater.

Tonight at dusk we linger by the fence

or seems to decide, the tease is over,
and throws its petals backward like a sail
in wind, a suddenness about this as though
it screams, almost the way a newborn screams
at pain and want and cold, and I still hear
that cry in the shout across the garden
to say another flower is about to break.
I go to where my daughter stands, flowers
strung along the vine like Christmas lights,
one not yet lit. We praise the world by making
others see what we see. So now she points and feels

from itself. And then she turns to look at me.

His shoulders globed like a full sail strung
Between the shafts and the furrow.
The horses strained at his clicking tongue.
An expert. He would set the wing
And fit the bright steel-pointed sock.
The sod rolled over without breaking.

Of reins, the sweating team turned round
And back into the land. His eye
Narrowed and angled at the ground,
Mapping the furrow exactly.

Fell sometimes on the polished sod;
Sometimes he rode me on his back
Dipping and rising to his plod.

To close one eye, stiffen my arm.

A tool for piercing holes. Particularly in leather. A simple metal shaft. A knob of wood for handle, polished by its fit in the sinewy cradle of a leather-worker’s  palm. Likely the tool with which Louis Braille blinded himself as a child in France. An accident in his father’s saddle-making shop in the early years of the nineteenth century. Braille later invented a system of raised dots as a means of reading and writing for the blind. We don’t know much. Whether he was in the shop with his father or snuck in alone. Whether it was damp and rainy or whether the sun shone and brought to life the floating dust that always hung in the workshop air. Maybe it was just a little poke in the eye. A small tool, a small slip of the hand, a small injury. How a little fumble ends in blindness. It was decades before general anesthetic or antiseptics. Perhaps the doctor they rushed him to believed in the value of “laudable pus” in a wound. I don’t want to picture it. As a child, playing in his father’s saddle-making shop, did Louis Braille already know the names of the parts of a saddle—cantle, pommel, stirrup, tree? Did he know the smell and feel of each grade of leather? Of all the tools—punch and pincers, gouge and groover, chisel and awl—he chose awl.

Red blood cells live some hundred days before they are worn out by their silent hustle—looping and looping, pounded through the heart’s chambered cathedral, rushing out to the farthest reaches of the body with the good news of oxygen, squeezing single file along capillaries, like anxious deer probing their tracks through the woods. Rushing, silent, looping the circuits of the body. Again, again, again. Load iron. Dump iron. Load dump squeeze hustle.
Red blood cells pushed through the capillaries that pushed through my  retinas. They broke loose to run a green swarm in the corral of my eye. But that is history. Today cells still push through the capillaries fenced off by my calloused fingerprint. This one that I run over the Braille cell, the pattern of bumps.

A red blood cell is measured in microns. A solitary prison cell is measured in feet. Six feet by nine feet or less.

The eye, for lack of practice, loses its ability to make out what lies in the distance. I don’t have a unit of measure for what this does to the heart.

A Braille cell is measured in spaces in a grid—two across by three down—that can be filled with a raised dot or bump. Different combinations of dots represent different letters, punctuation, symbols, shorthand.

The oldest cell I find in the dictionary is the monastic cell, a place for contemplation. From the concealed place where wine was stored. As in cellar. I find Braille contemplative. I touch my index finger to a bumpy piece of paper. My hand advances slowly left to right, the touch receptors in my finger triggered by the uneven contact of paper and skin. Messages run along nerves, finger-to-brain, brain-to-finger. Cognition sizzles. Mind notices this feels different than the pathway of sound in ear to auditory processing. Listening pulls me out into the world in an infinity of directions. Touching my reading educates me on my exact location in the world, feet in shoes, weight of foot on ground, weight of bones and flesh in chair.

Before you sink away
into the morphinesweet unreality of the everyday
we would like to say something
about those spasms and fasciculations of yours
as well as that bump on your back
For years you have no doubt been googling every freckle
Just recently
you were at the doctor’s with a patch of dry skin on your leg
Diagnosis: too much shower gel
But on hearing the word chondrosarcoma
you went home and immediately unplugged your router
Do you know where your priorities lie?
Do you know what life has to offer
or did those endless therapy sessions
and that eight-week mindfulness course
simply teach you how to tolerate suffering
that every signal in your body
can be temporarily expelled
to the rhythm of some breathing exercise?Let the pain beTo be free is to be free of need
Wrong
To be free is to need some fresh air
and to be able to get up and go outside

Yes, I am a body of rags lying
here on the bridge waiting for
a hot rain to wash me open,
dissolve me off the bridge
because this border is closed.
I rot on the boundary line
and can’t enter Juarez,
pennies thrown at me
when a drunk El Pasoan
returns in the darkness
and sees my shape that
makes him hurry across.
No head, decades ago they threw
it in the river without my screams.
My arms were the first to go
when I couldn’t climb the wall.
I can never leave this bridge.
I live on the pure line that divides
countries and grabs my hunger
from sliding into Mexico with
my outstretched hands.
I still have my knees.
I used to be sold in Juarez and
smuggled into El Paso, the egg
that floated down the Rio Grande
to break hundreds of miles away
before being thrown back.
I stay on the bridge and can’t move.
Do not cross to El Paso without wiping
your shoes of me, one foot on US
concrete, the other scraping away
at my Mexican rags.
When I struggle against the wire fence,
I make sure I salute two flags.

lost between the darkness and

the buildings are torn and

Shrines made of dung and branches,
With berries for eyes and burlap hung with holly.

For twenty-one years.
Seven trees times three
Planted for the first children.
Oh its land was a meadow
And our little house, a grape arbor
And a Wampanoag
Grave in a grove of elms.
Then a tree like an elephant
Bucked in a storm.
And its trunk broke into
A wrinkled little stump.
Roots don’t give up.
And stones only breathe once a year.
Many people passed through.
We could have watered more
Or flowered a path
For the visitors. After all
Love meant life and its shadow.
Children played and grew.
I too grew old for no reason.
Love stood at a distance.

The huddling April buds

Damns all but one, the littlest.

Fly from Sepiessa.

We almost sit together
But our feet of shadows
Show failed land deals.
Steps lowered and slimy
On a slip into the lagoon.
Ghoulish are the ghosts
Of time past: ancestors
With our same names.

Sunrise ocher marks
the river’s forehead,
wet dhotis betray supplicants
bare as opaque windows,
their secrets. It’s no secret,
my petals wreath
my crown in marigold, a glow
I’ve nursed into nova
when I cracked, from drought,
my pericarp, thirsty for God.
I have always been
a honey man,
coat of a langur, pilgrim-
body of fruit-
offering cast onto the tongue
of deity I prayed would move
in me. No sweetmeat
to sugar the idol
carved of me. The devout
fill brass kettles,
fill God with God,
to offer running water to Sun,
as mantras insist
from the temples;
the adhan’s pollen drifts—
yes, God is great.
Along the ghats
umbrellas bloom in red,
I breathe into nostrils of marble:The name of God is Truth—
vendors hawk neem branches
to scour mouths in bitter.

                ","
With “Waltzing Matilda,” funnel web spiders, and echidnas out of the way, you move on to the villanelle. The alien learns quickly, and soon the rhyme scheme and refrain are being applied to whatever it encounters: moonlight filling a green bucket by the door, a dog’s tooth in furniture, the sound of a nail gun. You go to bed and dream of planets disappearing like balls in a perfect snooker clearance. In the morning you find the walls papered with villanelles, each one signed by what appears to be a bar code. When you scan one with your phone, the screen lights up with footage of a satellite flyby through the heliosphere, trailing the sound of whale song, children crying, sustained applause, and Blind Willie Johnson’s “Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground.”

How do I compare the costs
Of leaving one system
Of cooperation
For another
System of cooperation?
How do I loosen the tongue
Enough to inhabit
The temple incognito?
What are the people to me
Until I condense my hesitations
And drink in stillness with
The rest of us, slightly drunk
But pacing moderately
Around the dew, dropped
To the knees at a tepid hour?
Cooperation is free, or is it
So? A refugee has no terms
Of comparison. Who really is
Aggrieved is a real fugitive
To freedom. The only enemies
Of freedom are border agents
And those dozing on one side
Of the other. The border condition
Realizes the personality.
That is why it has to be
Negotiated again in public
Houses. I tried to be loved
And everyone else failed me.
The dew is a corrosive.
It’s only obvious once
The horizon tempers
The topography again.
And this is so only when
Earthlight can be confined
By the foreground.
Allegorists are not agents
Now so much as internet vernaculars
We all get our chance to innovate.
Nations cannot be explained
Otherwise. Someone, we,
Made up the whole thing.
I want us to think we were
Liars then but are dying to
Finally grow up, no longer
Following fictions. But
Perfectly flush corroborating
Rehearsals.
The students can always
Have the data
They deserve.
What is oligarchy?
They call it up
And it clicks.
(Hear the disconsolate
fizz of epiphany
pitched out of library windows
and welfare field office exits.)
Everything can be
Said to have
Occurred. But do
They describe themselves
As belated or latent?
The reveal is just a mild
Turning in
Any case.
The air in winter
Is best for your device.
Cordon it around your
Device’s appetite.
Or there will be
A disaster
For the recollection,
Proof by perdurable
Association. (Check
the custom, or costume,
that to learn is
a bargain first fixed
in the recognition of ignorance
for which the learned refuse
to serve as models.)
Students delay excitement
Just long enough
And then they know.
You are a student
By profession.
If you insist
You deserve
A livelihood
You will be
Persecuted
For this
And that is
What has become
Of forensics.
That is the
Rootless fact.
Its reason is
Untraceable, so
Its stolid justice proffers
Souls for history’s
Paltry set of names
Of strangers. To
Assimilate novelty
Is then to obtain inventory.
What will you do
With it all?
Won’t you enjoy
The leverage it provides
So as to insist
On more?
It is not data
But esteem.
That is the remaining
Root system,
That nothing will
Have to be
Enough.

For Alexander Moysaenko



The black heart of the moon’s visible
through the trees from here.
Where are you?
I’m alone on the road
with a dead phone.
The birds are flapping overhead
but there’s not much light to be guided by.
If any horizon becomes visible enough to follow.
Forget the rain’s smear,
the chafe of fabric at the calf.
The money ran out. The diners are stuffed
and back for more.
Each terrible thing I said to the child
will get repeated hopefully as a joke.
And like language, these gestures, or a certain way of nodding
one’s head, it all eases in with less than a breath.
Forget the song’s words, the order of the band’s set tonight.
The black moon’s heart’s
got that sinister bent
and I want to get
touched at by the snakes.
One of the students in my class
used to go bear hunting with his two uncles.
They played recordings of distressed animals
to lure in tentative animals to kill.
This practice is illegal in many places.
Because it’s so very effective.
I split open the apple
and hand the good half to a child on the bus
nestled in under the arm of her sleeping mother.
Love from here is a long way to go.
Get on your bike and ride
through the lights.

                ","
It’s so flat here you can see everything. It’s not romantic. Nobody can slip in or out in secret, and who among us has pumped the last worry through her heart?
Collapsing into shade, I wish for more sons, endless daughters: a higher ratio of my people to other people. Why not want what I want; since we used all the air conditioning it’s become impossible to think things through.
Can you believe your ears? All the electric music in the world has been turned into handbells. I wish I had a cushion for my knees instead of gloves to keep the handbells pure. We can get used to anything. That doesn’t mean we should.
I went to a wedding where everything was outrageous but trying to act  modest by including very goofy elements, such as people in bear costumes and gold nuggets descending from the ceiling, only to be jerked back up out of reach when people tried to grab them.
Long ago, a matrimonial family collected a few eggs from each household in the village to contribute to the wedding cake. A pig for the dinner: a gift from a rich great-uncle. Shortly after, there was a period of department store gift services and electro-synth harps for hire.
But now we pick dandelions to make wine, and pluck chickens to make fine the groom’s cloak. He wants large brown wings; he wants wolf pelt for his loins. He wants he wants he wants. There is no end to that.
The bride is someone who has only ever served. No use asking someone who’s once had a true taste of freedom, whose eyes widened and whose pelvis thrust up unbidden. Better she be someone who might never know what she lost.
It is as it ever was. How many centuries have brides been made and used in this way?
How few centuries have let women be girls first, swirling as long as they wanted into their sweetness and sharpening to ripeness, only becoming women once full heavy love was their desire inside and out. Maybe one. Maybe not quite one full century.

It was like climbing a mountain to those of us who’d climbed one. To the others, it was like, I suppose, something else. In other words, we let  everybody find her own figure of speech.
Not that it—speech—lay thick on the ground, or mountain; it presented itself one word at a time, far between. A body had to keep an eye out, like for firewood at dusk, or else
miss her chance. Nobody else, let’s face it, cared about metaphor, or even simile, the like-it-or-not-ness of the mountain pretty much getting  between a body and her musing, in its going. One
step at a time, anyone could lose herself or someone else just staring at her feet. And if a body meet a body is not mere speech but something that could happen, like hopping a bus—though on the mountain
you’ll catch no rides, worse luck, the mountain requires to be climbed on foot, one after the other, nothing else will get you up it. There’s nothing like such obduracy but in the wild, nobody can tell you otherwise. No simple figure,
this struggle: just a crag, your burden, and your own two feet. Say  otherwise, talk through your hat, which I don’t care for.

1
The leaves sleeping beneath the wind:
A vessel for the wound.
Time perishing: the glory of the wound.
The trees rising among our lashes:
A lake for the wound.
The wound lies in bridges
When the grave lengthens,
When patience stretches
Between the banks of our love and death.
The wound, a gesture, is passing.
2
I give the voice of the wound
To the tongue of strangled bells,
To stone approaching from afar,
To aridity and the arid land,
To time borne on a stretcher of ice,
I kindle the fire of the wound.
When history burns in my garments,
When blue nails sprout in my book,
When I shout during the day,
Who are you? Who’s thrusting you
Into my notebooks,
Into my virgin earth?
In my notebooks, in my virgin earth,
I glimpse two eyes of dust
And hear someone say,
“I am the wound that grows
In your narrow history.”
3
I named you cloud,
Wound, dove of departure,
I named you quill and book.
And here I am, starting a dialogue
Between myself and the drowned tongue
On the isles of exodus,
On the archipelago of the ancient fall.
And here I am, teaching the dialogue
To the wind and palms—
Wound, dove of departure.
4
Had I a harbor, had I a vessel
In the land of dreams and mirrors,
Had I the remains
Of a city, had I a city
In the land of children and weeping,
I would forge them all for the wound
Into a spear-like song
That pierces trees and stones and sky,
A song as supple as water,
Unruly and dazed, like conquest.
5
World adorned with dreams and yearning,
Rain down on our deserts,
Rain down, but shake us, palms of the wound,
And break two branches off for us
From the trees that love the silence of the wound,
From the trees with arched lashes and hands
That keep vigil over the wound.
World adorned with dreams and yearning,
World falling in my brow,
Drawn like the wound,
Come no closer—the wound is closer than you.
Don’t tempt me—the wound is more beautiful,
And the wound has passed by that enchantment
Cast by your eyes
In the last kingdoms,
Passed without leaving a sail to tempt it astray,
Without leaving it an island.

I amuse myself with my country.
     I glimpse its future approaching on the eyelashes of an ostrich, I toy with its history and its days, I strike it with stones and thunderbolts. I extinguish its lamps and light its windows, and at the other end of day I inaugurate its history.
I am a stranger to all of you. I am from the other end. I live in a country of my own, inflating the sky to see its ashes, and in sleeping and waking I open a bud to live within.
Something must be born, so I bore caverns in my skin for lightning and build nests. I must pass like thunder into lips as sad as straw, between stone and autumn, between pore and epidermis, between thigh and thigh.
      And so I sing: “Form worthy of our demise—advance.”
     And so I shout and sing: “Who will give us the maternity of the cosmos, who will nourish us with mines?”
I advance toward my self, toward ruins. The silence of calamity takes me—I’m too short to gird the earth like a rope, I’m not sharp enough to pierce the face of history and plunge in.
You want me to be like you. You boil me in the cauldron of your prayers; you mix me with the broth of armies and the pepper of tyrants, then pitch me like a tent for the wali and hoist my skull like a flag.
     (My death,
     Nevertheless I run toward you, I rush rush rush to you.)
You live like flagstones, and lamentation is your air. You announce the hedgehog’s abode and sleep on the scarab’s censers—your children are immolations.
A distance as great as a mirage divides us.
I rouse hyenas in you, I rouse the gods. I sow sedition in you and suckle fever, then teach you to journey without a guide. I am a pole for your latitudes and a walking springtime. I am a convulsion in your throats, a hemorrhage in your words.
You advance like leprosy toward me, and I am the one bound to your dirt. Yet nothing unites us, everything divides us—so let me burn alone, let me pass through you like a spear of light.
     I cannot live with you, I cannot live without you. You are an undulation in my senses, and I cannot escape you. Even so, cry out, “The sea, the sea!” Even so, hang the beads of the sun on your thresholds.
Open my memory and study my face beneath its words, learn my alphabet. When you see foam weaving my flesh and stone flowing in my blood, you will see me.
      I am closed like a tree trunk, present and ungraspable like air. Thus I cannot surrender to you.
I was born in the sockets of lilacs, I grew in the orbits of lightning, I live with light and grass. I storm and I clear up, I shine and cloud over, I rain and snow—the hours are my language, and my country is day.The people are sleeping, but if they die they’ll awaken, or so it was said. You are all sleeping, but if you awaken you’ll die, or so it shall be said.
     You are dirt on my windowpanes, and I must remove you. I am the coming morning and the map that draws itself.
Nevertheless, there’s a fever in my bowels that keeps vigil over you.
     Nevertheless, I await you,
     In the shell of night by the sea, in the roaring of the depths, in the holes in the robe of the sky, in the jujubes and acacias, in the pines and cedars, in the hearts of the waves, in the salt,
      I await you.

Our city fled,
So I sought its paths in haste
And looked around—I saw only horizon,
And I perceived that those who flee tomorrow
And those who return tomorrow
Are a body I tear apart on my page.
I could see: the clouds were a throat,
The water formed walls of flame.
I saw a sticky yellow thread,
A thread of the history that clings to me.
A hand mulls over my life, ties my days together
Time and again, a hand that was heir
To the race of dolls and the progeny of rags.
I entered the rites of creation
In the waters’ womb and the trees’ virginity,
I saw trees seducing me,
I saw rooms among their branches,
Beds and windows resisting me,
I saw children and read them
My sand, I read them
Suras of clouds and verses of stone,
I saw them journeying with me,
I saw pools of tears and the corpse of rain
Gleaming behind them.
Our city fled—
What am I? A spike of grain
Weeping for a lark
That died beneath the snow and cold,
Died without revealing its messages,
Died without writing anyone.
I questioned it and saw its corpse
Discarded at the end of time,
And I cried out, “Silence of the ice, I
Am the home of the exiled lark.
Its grave is my home, and I’m an exile.”
Our city fled,
And I saw my feet transform
Into a river overflowing with blood,
Into ships growing distant, expanding,
And I saw my drowned shores seducing ...
My waves were wind and pelicans.
Our city fled,
And refusal is a crushed pearl
Whose powder anchors my ships,
And refusal is a woodcutter living
On my face—it gathers me and sets me on fire—
And refusal is the distance that disperses me.
I see my blood and I see my death
Beyond my blood:
It speaks to me and pursues me.
Our city fled,
And I saw how my shroud illumines me,
I saw ... If only death would grant me time.

creature—well, there are flaws in the mind of Jane, too,
and the awful figure bending over her
might be the tormented wife of Rochester.
There’s a flaw in Jane’s mind, too,
looking down on the young French child
born to another tormented mother
whom Rochester says has inherited sin.
The young French child likes presents too much,
likes to dance and sing—and so what? She is love-starved,
this child who has supposedly inherited sin,
who will never get the approval of Mr. Rochester.
We lose track of the pretty child who likes to sing.
Jane goes away for a while to prove her purity.
Then, when the other wife dies, Mr. Rochester
will approve. Reader, I married him, she says,
after she has gone away for a while. He is blind
from the fire the crazy wife set. And then, miraculously,
her love asks if she is wearing a blue dress.
I believe she is pregnant, then, carrying a child
who will be a good child, miraculously.
Charlotte Brontë knew only part of the happy ending.
Perhaps he gets better and sees the blue dress.
We have to believe things turn out well,
while Charlotte, herself, had nine months of pleasure
and died. And so the book, which ends as if resolved,
asks us to believe things turn out well, the French girl gone,
Rochester and Jane and the baby in the burned-out
mansion, because books then ended resolutely
and did not reflect how it is to have a calm life,
Rochester and Jane and the baby in the burned-out
mansion, illustrated by the art of the woodcut,
which does not suggest such a calm life,
but a knife and fire making art out of wood,
in a mansion that itself has been sculpted by
fire and breaking things, which is how we really live.

Nation of Domination
my mom hugs me & wants me to stay. i have my foot
on the pedal. a fake gold chain on my neck. i confess
i’m a sucker. i never want magicians to reveal their secrets.
i want to live in the unknowing where everything is possible.
my mom dances with me to Los Bukis. she thinks this makes
me her baby still. perspective is a magic trick. i hit my brother
with the Rock Bottom & i bet you can guess what i leave out.
ask Farooq if you need a hint. the brain is full of magic
i don’t understand. no one signs up to take a dive. in wrestling,
there’s a team of writers who decide who wins and who loses.
the metaphor is obvious. my mom wasn’t born to play the role
of mom, i don’t care how many baby dolls she played with.
i dance with my mom to Los Bukis & you’re a fool
if you believe it’s her son she’s trying to hold on to.

moonshine
the poets are right about the moonlight.
i take my spot of sky & deposit it
into a savings account. only after
the bank confiscated our house
did i understand. roses
don’t grow without pricked hands.
i didn’t have to spend a summer in a freezer
packing lunch meat to know the value
of sunlight. my mom didn’t have
to spend a decade wiping down floors to appreciate
education. when i give you a bouquet of roses,
i give you a bouquet of bloody hands.
a handful of dirt & the worms that doted on your roses.
when i take my piece of sky out of the bank,
it’s smaller. the drunks are right about moonshine.

Runs with no interval,

About the same things.

Of blue behind her

You are dark as religion. Remember God
could not have named a modicum of light without you.
You are plum, black currant, passion
fruit in another woman’s garden. You are Black
as and as if by magic. Black not as sin, but a cave’s jaw
clamped shut by forgiveness. Color of closed wombs and bellies
of ships, you, dark as not the tree trunk but its every cleft.
I chart each crescent moon rising above fingernail
and rub together my thighs for want of you. I try
to find you where the pages of books meet. You hang
where men or piano keys segregate. When I miss you,
I remember the hickey the sun left on the back of my neck.
If I forget, I smoke blunts down to my fingertips
and beg you to come on my lips. This is how I pray for you
when I’m not pessimistic. I bow to your darkness like I kneel
beside a child’s bed, confessing as gospel, there’s no monster here.

The sinner’s bouquet, house of shredded & tornDear John letters, upended grave of names, moonBlack kiss of a pistol’s flat side, time blueborn
& threaded into a curse, Lazarus of hustlers, the picayune
Spinning into beatdown; breath of a thief stilledBy fluorescent lights, a system of 40 blocks,Empty vials, a hand full of purple cranesbills,
Memories of crates suspended from stairs, tied in knots
Around streetlamps, the house of unending push-ups,Wheelbarrows & walking 20s, the daughtersChasing their fathers’ shadows, sons that upset
The wind with their secrets, the paraphrase of fractured,Scarred wings flying through smoke, each wild hourOf lockdown, hunger time & the blackened flower.

Of lockdown, hunger time & the blackened flower —Ain’t nothing worth knowing. Prison becomes home;
The cell: a catacomb that cages and the metronomeTracking the years that eclipse you. History authors
Your death, throws you into that din of lost hours.Your mother blames it all on your X chromosome,
Blames it on something in the blood, a Styrofoam
Cup filled with whiskey leading you to court disfavor,
To become drunk on count-time & chow-call logic.There is no name for this thing that you’ve become:
Convict, hostage, inmate, lifer, yardbird, all fail.If you can’t be free, be a mystery. An amnesic.
Anything. But avoid succumbing to the humdrum:
Swallowing a bullet or even just choosing to inhale.
3
Swallowing a bullet or even just choosing to inhale,Both mark you: pistol or the blunt to the head
Escorting you through the night. Your Yale—An omen, the memories, the depression, the dead
And how things keep getting in the way of things.
When he asked you for the pistol, and you said no,The reluctance wasn’t about what violence brings.
His weeping in your ear made you regret what you owed.
On some days, the hard ones, you curse the phone,The people calling collect, reaching out, all buried,
Surrounded by bricks. On some days, you’ve known
You wouldn’t answer, the blinking numbers as varied
As the names of the prisons holding on to those lives,
Holding on, ensuring that nothing survives.
4Holding on, ensuring that nothing survives,
Not even regret. That’s the thing that gets you,
Holding on to memories like they’re your archives,Like they’re there to tell you something true
About what happened. My past put a skewOn how I held her. Unaccustomed to touch,
I knew only dream & fantasy. Try to see through
That mire and find intimacy. It was just so much.& then, the yesterdays just become yesterday,
A story that you tell yourself about not dying,
Another thing, when it’s mentioned, to downplay.
That’s what me and that woman did, trying
To love each other. What kind of fool am I,
Lost in what’s gone, reinventing myself with lies.
5
Lost in what’s gone, reinventing myself with lies:
I walk these streets, ruined by what I’d hide.
Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine.
I barely see my daughters at all these days.Out here caught up, lost in an old cliché.
But tell me, what won’t these felonies betray?
Did a stretch in prison to be released to a cell.Returned to a freedom penned by Orwell.
My noon temptation is now the Metro’s third rail.
In my wallet, I carry around my daguerreotype,A mugshot, no smiles, my name a tithe.
What must I pay for being this stereotype?
The pistols I carried into the night, my anchor;
The crimes that unraveled me, my banner.
6
The crimes that unraveled me—my banner.Only a fool confesses to owning that fact.
Honesty a sinkhole; the truth doomed to subtract
Everything but prayer, turn my breath into failure.Whiskey after prison made me crave amber,
Brown washing my glass until I’m smacked.The murder of crows on my arm an artifactOf freedom: what outlasts even the jailor.Alas, there is no baptism for me tonight.
No water to drown all these memories.The rooms in my head keep secrets that indict
Me still; my chorus of unspoken larcenies.You carry that knowledge into your twilight,
& live without regret for your guilty pleas.
7
& live without regret for your guilty pleas—Shit. Mornings I rise twice: once for a count
That will not come & later with the city’sWild birds, who find freedom without counsel.
I left prison with debts no honest man could pay.Walked out imaging I’d lapped my troubles,
but a girl once said no to my closed ears, dismayedthat I didn’t pause. Remorse can’t calm those evils.I’ve lost myself in some kind of algebra
That turns my life into an equation that zeroesOut, regardless of my efforts. Algophobia
Means to fear pain. I still fear who knowsAll I’ve done. Why regret this thing I’ve worn?

                ","
A collective family myth
passed down across generations
takes on the polished gleam of truth,
and memories become legend.
The legend of black sod-busters
on a piece of red soil they own
in a township of black ranchers.
Their legendary rodeo.grand entry
Two Stars and Stripes flutter into
the arena, carried by two
men in jeans, red shirts, white Stetsons.
Guiding their horses with left hands,
holding the flagstaffs in their rights,
their backs straight and tall, their faces,
their chestnut faces, beautiful
in the light of the setting sun.
After them, two by two,
banners waving, hooves raising dust,
ride the Horse People of Boley,
a varicolored promenade.
They canter once around the ring,
then they circle into the sky.mutton busting
In the cluster of five-year-old
contenders wearing life jackets
and bicycle helmets, paper
numbers safety-pinned to their backs,
you line up one by one for a turn
to hang on tight with your legs squeezed
at the sheep’s broad middle, fingers
holding handfuls of deep, warm wool
as the sheep destiny presents
runs you out to cheering applause.
Whether you’ll fall on top of it,
or it on you, you won’t fall far.
You have no front teeth anyway,
and a brown clown gone pick you up.bareback riding
This horse was bred and born to buck.
He’s a good horse, he’ll give you points.
Gloved hand in the rigging’s handle,
bare brown hand waving in the air,
you whir your spurs at his shoulders
as he leaps, twists, and jolts your bones.
Four seconds or four hundred years.
But if you can get up and slap
the dust off your jeans with your hat,
the future’s eyes, looking at you,
will fill with forevering light:
light that will make generations
of proud brown people remember
the Black Horse People of Boley.bulldogging
In truth there’s seldom a reason
for a man to wrestle a steer,
unless he’s a real ranch cowboy
dealing with ornery power.
Maybe, while rounding up the herd,
he bumps heads with testosterone,
and it’s testosterone-vs.-
testosterone. Bill Pickett learned,
watching dogs on a Boley ranch,
that sometimes you’ve got to bulldog
a hardhead with a kiss of pain.
Today, you slide from horse onto
the fleeing steer, grab his horns, pull
five hundred pounds of muscle down.team roping, calf roping, steer roping
Roping always involves a team,
whether it’s two men or women
or one human and one smart horse.
The aim: to bring down and hog-tie
a big scared baby of a calf
or a full-grown and pissed-off steer.
You gallop out swinging your loop
with one hand, the other holding
the slack and the unneeded reins.
You down him with a careful toss,
tie three of his hooves together,
step back with wide arms and a grin.
A rope isn’t always a noose:
ropes in brown hands can be lassos.saddle bronc riding
It’s not the leather riding gloves
and it’s not the fringed buckskin chaps,
not the worn-in and dusty boots,
not the spurs’ blunted silver stars,
not the 10x wide-brimmed straw hat
(both winged helmet and regal crown):
it’s not clothes that make the cowboy.
It’s something behind a bronzed face,
in the level gaze from dark eyes,
and, of course, it’s heart that puts you,
the reins in one hand, one hand free,
waving with the horse’s rhythm,
your heels spurring from neck to flank,
on this bronc called America.barrel racing
Thunder explodes out of the chute.
Mane and tail whip in the speed wind,
agile hooves pound a swift tempo
circling around the first barrel.
One hand grips the horn, the other
communicates with the taut reins,
though your thighs give the best guidance,
telling your horse to maneuver
in circles that hug the barrels.
Three barrels, a tight cloverleaf
you gallop through with one joined will.
This contest pits you and your horse
against the clock and your best time.
Sister, your dreadlocks are flying!pony express
Before telegraph, news traveled
from mouth to ear, from hand to hand.
News arrived old. From sea to sea
took weeks, unless carried by boys
stationed along the stagecoach route
to race a cross-country relay.
Your pulse gallops toward the handoff,
when your teammate takes the baton
and the noise and flurry go on
without you. Your leg run, you and
your horse (your partner, your friend) stand
encompassed in adrenalin,
watching, as the Ancestors must,
unable to help, but cheering.tennessee walker
Let’s hear it for the barrel men,
for the bullfighters, for the clowns,
for the men on the side ready
to run toward trouble. Give it up
for the musical director
(thanks for the hip-hop, bro!). And for
the announcer and all the folks
cheering in the stands. That baby
wearing a tiny cowboy hat.
That man the same black as his horse,
in that white suit and fedora.
His Tennessee Walker’s proud gait
as he nods to his own rhythm,
tail an ebony waterfall.bull riding
Boley bulls are bred for bucking,
bred to be mean, to be “Bad Boys.”
They teach you to sit strong, hold on,
and with one hand reach for the sky.
After riding a Boley bull
a cowboy thinks, Hell, I’ve been there.
I’ve held the bull-rope, raked my spurs,
while that bad boy tried to kill me.
A ton of Brahma seeing red
gives you a whole new perspective,
a who-you-think-you-talking-to
fearlessness. You’ve seen the bull’s eye:
you know you can’t die more than once.
You’ve lived through eight Mississippis.

Especially in line for the food bank,
my mother radiated grace. Talked
a machinery of Principles. Elm trees
and their dresses of urine, her small mouth

This daily commitment to life felt laborious, haram.
Expendable it was, like all my milk teeth

What even is sustenance? She was a woman of Principles,
she flossed, her exquisite fangs displaying remorse
only when she reprimanded me or talked of the coat.

nagging on the chicken bone gray as the sky.

my dinner from a health store on 6th Ave,

Is a wing a muscle? 3 Best Exercises to Building Badass Wings,
says the ad and the man in the subway
sprawled across hard plastic  looks like
a glorious bone. In his odor, I feel at home.
Consider his careful dedication to repose.
There is something he has mastered genuinely,
his fist curled around it.  Sleeps on two cushions,
one for his ass. She was a woman of Principles. 
Consider her stark god of oblivion.

Uniformly standing in line, a dark puff, plume on the wing.
The wing patched to the torso of a body entirely ignorant of aerodynamics.
The world hadn’t hurt us more than
it had hurt anyone else, but still, I couldn’t trust
the sky and its reverberations.
In line, I made friends with a family
of crickets in white lab coats.
They sang to me, of the end of it,
that wings were awaiting us there:
stale bread rolls, a cheese pie,
Braeburn apples sharing space
with two cans of tomatoes.

At one time,
if my nails had been painted
this shade of rose-foam in Kabul
they would have rammed

To be a statue               carved by Bernini

Like the luxury of a personal pan pizza            with unlimited free toppings
Or the luxurious feel of a premium eye pencil          used to draw bisons on the walls of a French cave
To be so white and glossy                   is unimaginable
Like how I imagine a plate of eggs painted by Velázquez           or the lid of a designer toilet cistern
In a European magazine                       (I could be European
And wear a dashingly arranged scarf          or sip weirdly-named liqueurs that taste like semen

Like the marvel of an isthmus           whose name can only be pronounced if you have a lisp
Or the marvelous sausage                that saved a man from the Inquisition in 1582
It is definitely marvelous                    to be as attenuated
As the casually extended leg of a greyhound                   reclining on its very own velvet settee
To be so thoroughbred                          is an accomplishment

The way a designer toilet cistern is admired               or a piece of elaborate pâtisserie

As when catching a carelessly thrown baby              or pointing at two meteors at the same time)

 updates its inversion of the air
 even more than did the air displace
when she grew from brown-eyed baby
into strong laboring woman in blue jeans
  and heathered wool,
and if the air and earth draw from Megan’s corpse
  all the energy and minerals
 she pulled from her surrounds
to build her nails and bones and teeth—
 if the exchange doesn’t stop

it found relation,

To call him back      instead he watched a forest

Fully grown tree down then he watched the tree as
The humans dragged it to their camp he watched the
Tree as the humans broke the tree apart he
Watched as the humans carved the parts of the tree in-

We gathered in a field southwest of town,
several hundred hauling coolers
and folding chairs along a gravel road
dry in August, two ruts of soft dust
that soaked into our clothes
and rose in plumes behind us.
By noon we could discern their massive coils
emerging from a bale of cloud,
scales scattering crescent dapples
through walnut fronds,
the light polarized, each leaf tip in focus.
As their bodies blotted out the sun,
the forest faded to silverpoint.
A current of cool air
extended from the bottomlands
an intimation of October,
and the bowl of sky deepened
its celestial archaeology.
Their tails, like banners of a vast army,
swept past Orion and his retinue
to sighs and scattered applause,
the faint wail of a child crying.
In half an hour they had passed on
in search of deep waters.
Before our company dispersed,
dust whirling in the wind,
we planned to meet again in seven years

I thought very hard and thought of nothing.
—Jesse Ball, Census
In one segment of the landscape, a hyena drags her clitoris
across the plains, a dust perfuming up. Cicadas pulse the segment,
a femur filled with rain. It is a lush grassland within which
the greens have sprouted through the exposed joints of animals.
This seems to be a metaphor for growth and resistance. A
single singed dollar rolls through the wind. I read
a book that imagines, among other things, a world without
trees. I wrote a book that imagines, among other things, a world
without men. The book splayed open on my parents’ dresser,
an early part of the book. People do this when they no longer
want to see information. I no longer want to see information.
In another segment, a series of weasel oil candles, such is
the cure-all in this aspect of land. Mostly the candles are not
lit. At night the moon makes the earth shine like bottle
flies, a glimmer here and there where a lachrymose flame
continues on. A god peeks past the clit of the hyena
disapprovingly, as evidenced by their glare and nod. But I
want a god to glare and nod. I want a god to do anything at all
with my debts. In another segment, my grandmother
lives and she watches a pack of lionesses feasting inside
the rib cage of a zebra. At first, she tells us, she believes
the zebra to be sleeping on her side, but the lions move
her skin under the membrane of bones.
It’s like I always say: The evenings wait for the kind of
death we get and we are so very fond of the evenings.
In another segment, the last one, we know it to be last
because a single woman is braiding her hair in a desert.
We have been here before. An animal raises her leg.

from me. I tried to warn you, this desert editorializes.
A scorpion lifts its tail, braids more active than braiding,

to the kind of life we want until we turn our heads east.
The night fills without us but I warned you, I was full
already. A banana inside me blasted open a door,
my thoughts at the threshold of such a door blank. Love
transacts, a figure in the distance crowded with window.
An enzyme eats plastic, but which kind? Synthetic polymer

First the people had to invent ladders. No one had ever seen a ladder. Once they had ladders they invented walls to climb over. Soon they realized it took two ladders to climb a wall. One to climb up one side—one to climb down the other. People would ascend one side of the wall, descend the other side of the wall, and then walk away, leaving the ladders behind. That is why there are so many ladders in the world. The ladders are picked up and stored in an enormous warehouse. Scientists have proposed attaching all the ladders, one on top of the other, creating an elevator into outer space. Some people want to destroy all the ladders. Others want to destroy the walls. Others say that someday we are going to need all the ladders in the world.

stretch of sand on Hawaii’s Big Island. It is a new stone, a fusion
of natural and manufactured materials. “If [plastiglomerates] are
buried within the strata,” says Jan Zalasiewicz, an English geologist,
“I don’t see why they can’t persist in some form for millions of years.”

Aggregates increase “like snow.” Aggregation theory represents
a two-state system [“time for chemistry, kids”] ... to characterize
the formation of marine aggregates and the loss due to sinking:
 
  
where· C1 is the concentration of the cells· r is the radius of each cell· G is the shearing rate· α is the stickiness coefficient· g is the growth rate.
Thus, aggregation of marine particles is more prevalent when
cell and particle concentration is higher (e.g. algal blooms).

Wikipedia: marine snow is a variety of mostly organic matter,
including dead or dying animals, and plankton ... also plant parts
and degrading plant material. Because of the relatively long
residence time of the ocean’s thermohaline circulation, carbon
transported as marine snow into the aphotic zone by the biological
pump can remain out of contact ... for more than a thousand years.A blue jay lands in the fringe tree. Sudden downfall of petals.

Be hourglass in the pillaged O—.
Be wells none see. Unstoppered tears,
O oud, we gather in your bowl.
O ladle of ores, scoop ink here
now seeping from the foreigner,
be sighs, O oud, and cloven aches
in the dark of millions of ears.
Be gift for famished wails and wakes
to lacks and flares and tented stakes,

eating wind and drowning faces.

Long after I stopped participating
Those images pursued me
I found myself turning from them
Even in the small light before dawn
To meet the face of my own body
Still taut and strong, almost too
Strong a house for so much shame
Not mine alone but also yours
And my brother’s, lots of people’s,
I know it was irrational, for whom I saw
Myself responsible and to whom
I wished to remain hospitable.
We had all been pursuing our own
Disintegration for so long by then
That by the time the other side
Began to raise a more coherent
Complaint against us we devolved
With such ease and swiftness it seemed
To alarm even our enemies. By then
Many of us had succumbed to quivering
Idiocy while others drew vitality from new
Careers as public scolds. Behind these
Middle-management professors were at pains
To display their faultless views lest they too
Find censure, infamy, unemployment and death
At the hands of an enraged public
Individuals in such pain and torment
And such confusion hardly anyone dared
Ask more of them than that they not shoot
And in fact many of us willed them to shoot
And some of us were the shooters
And shoot we did, and got us square
In the heart and in the face, which anyway
We had been preparing these long years
For bullets and explosions and whatever
Else. A vast unpaid army
Of self-destructors, false comrades, impotent
Brainiacs who wished to appear to be kind
Everything we did for our government
And the corporations that served it we did for free
In exchange for the privilege of watching one
Another break down. Sometimes we were the ones
Doing the breaking. We would comfort one another
Afterward, congratulating each other on the fortitude
It took to display such vulnerability. The demonstration
Of an infirmity followed by a self-justificatory recuperation
Of our own means and our own ends, in short, of ourselves
And our respect for ourselves—this amounted to the dominant
Rhetoric of the age, which some called sharing, which partook
Of modes of oratory and of polemic, of intimate
Journals and of statements from on high issued by public
Figures, whom at one time or another we all mistook ourselves for.
Anyway it wasn’t working. None of it was working.
Not our ostentation and not the uses we put our suffering
To, the guilt- and schadenfreude-based attention
We extracted from our friends and followers, and even the passing
Sensation of true sincerity, of actual truth, quickly emulsified
Into the great and the terrible metastasizing whole.
To the point it began to seem wisest to publish only
Within the confines of our own flesh, but our interiors
Had their biometrics too, and were functions not only
Of stardust, the universe as we now were prone to addressing
The godhead, but also of every mean and median of the selfsame
Vicious culture that drove us to retreat into the jail of our own bones
And the cramped confines of our swollen veins and ducts in the first place
Our skin was the same wall they talked about on the news
And our hearts were the bombs whose threat never withdrew
Images could drop from above like the pendulum in “The Pit
And the Pendulum” or killer drones to shatter the face of our lover
Into contemporaneous pasts, futures, celebrities, and other
Lovers all of whom our attention paid equally in confusion
And longing, and a fleeting sense like passing ghosts
Of a barely-remarked-upon catastrophe that was over
Both before and after it was too late. We were ancient
Creatures, built for love and war. Everything said so
And we could not face how abstract it was all becoming
Because it was also all the opposite of abstract, it was
Our flesh, our mother’s bloodied forehead
On the floor of Penn Station, and wherever we hid
Our face, amid a crowd of stars for example as Yeats
Once put it, and for stars insert celebrities
Or astrology here, your choice, and even when
We closed our eyes, all this was all we looked at
Every day all day. It was all we could see.
We were lost in a language of images.
It was growing difficult to speak. Yet talk
Was everywhere. Some of us still sought
To dominate one another intellectually
Others physically; still others psychically or some
Of all of the above, everything seeming to congeal
Into bad versions of sports by other means
And sports by that time was the only metaphor
Left that could acceptably be applied to anything.
The images gave us no rest yet failed over
And over despite the immensity
Of their realism to describe the world as we really
Knew it, and worse, as it knew us

thinking it was the doctor
she asks me how come dogs here have doctors
I say because dogs here are domesticated
the opposite of domestic is alien the opposite of flower
is fist the opposite of purple is pray
orchid comes from the Greek word meaning [testicle]
Greek women believed eating orchids made their unborn
babies boys
for a son, my mother creamed her toes suckled coals liquefied flies fucked on full moon
days flossed with a dagger darkened her bathwater ashed her cheekbones torched her crotch
candied the blood boiled it with sugar & still
she wept when she saw my face
filmed it with her fingers
weeded out my eyes & witched them into rivers
my grandfather farmed orchids in a city named thirst
when the war came, he pissed on his field
to keep the orchids alive, he spent all his body’s water
his organs dehydrated into stones I skip across sea-mirrors
flowers bruise in the wind & weaponless
crimes are called births
water perpetrates want
the army unburied our bodies in a field of salty orchids
everyone in my family resembles a river’s
rag-dolled neck
in photos our faces overlap like venn diagrams of grief
there is a breed of orchid called the ghost orchid & another breed called the blood orchid
one is fictional & the other is edible & the other
night I vased my throat like a stem & did not think of extinct species
decades later reappearing like the lungfish
one of the original fish that left the sea for land
all migrations begin as mothers as mimicry
a fish saw a tree & decided to stand
without feet my brother says orchids
look like pussies smell like
pussies too he says I should know
I do know I know the color of thirst
is not salt but cylinder but a city leased to fire
to architect the ash into an alibi

I tell him to touch his toes. He reaches for them in a squat.
He stabs them with his little fingers. One toe. Two toes.
Then we say our letters, spell out all the sounds we will deliverbecause the death of a child is no small death.
I extend to him an open palm where he makes a fist
and slams it into my hand, a form, he wearily shouts,
is “a butterfly coming home!” We play “give me a five”
and continue swatting at the butterfliesuntil the sun goes down.
I don’t recall ever playing with my mother like this.
Late one morning, my son caught me pinching
the sides of my head, my face wet from so much crying.
He punched my arm, which knocked one hand off
of my face. Ashamed that he saw me, I laughed very loudly
which brought him concern and happiness. He never
mentioned it again and I never forgave myself.My good son, running through the garden
in giggles. He is waiting for me to catch him. Once
I pretended to have fallen in a pit. I did not tell him
it was a grave. Very quickly he sprinted over and stood
beside my body. “Your hand!” he demanded.
Like a little father. I gave him my hand.
“Now, the other hand!” I give him the other.

                    And the Moon on Its Stem Will Steal You Away
                ","
That’s a good one, the idea of the moon having a stem and somehow
stealing you, whoever you are, kind of like Persephone or Orpheus,
portrayed or alluded to in countless forms of art and popular culture
including poetry, film, opera, music, and painting. And it kind of fits
my mood this morning, something vaguely cartoonish and devoid
of real gravitas, but still, a kind of realism, even so. And the area
around is the void, outer space, nothing, because explaining things
is never as interesting as wanting them, the desire to know, set against
a backdrop of black velvet and rhinestones. Let’s say that you wake up
one day and realize you don’t remember anything that happened
yesterday. Maybe for five minutes or so. And for those five minutes
you’re thinking, as I was thinking this morning, that this is it. Car keys.
The word for when you really want something and work for it.
Your dog’s name. There are not enough blank pages for all this
forgetting, like debris falling back to earth, you and yours hiding in
the underbrush with hopes of your own, of rescue or escape.
When you don’t remember why you’re hiding in the underbrush,
you’ve been hiding in the underbrush forever. This whole other
existence leaps forward in possibility. And then the five minutes
are up, and it’s oh yeah, eggs, Saturday. Some day that was.
A chemist once told me luminol was her favorite color. It glows
a beautiful greenish-blue when it comes into contact with blood
by reacting to the iron in hemoglobin, looking a bit like the sky
this morning. It’s a kind of truth of blue, that uncovers, that
remembers. It’s used by investigators to detect blood at crime scenes
where no blood is visible. There are so many things to forget,
to lose, and in so many different ways. But even so, one can be wrong
about the past, and deduce from error, but still be right about
the future or the present. And when you don’t remember what day
it is, happy birthday. Despite all our best efforts, there’s a wolf
on the horizon making a movie of your approach, and it’s
a shipwreck playing across me as I’m pouring sugar into my cup.

what she told me. What I honor. They, as unambiguous as Lyrae is:
black, bard, badass; svelte with flourishing braids; a singularity and
somehow all of them gathered as one like tributaries to the mouth of
the river of God—Gwendolyn and Lucille and June and—and I can’t
count all the ways I was saved that day, emerging wet from the ritual
to find myself sitting in some stranger’s living room, a writer who’d
been pushed out of their homeland by its persecutions, pulled into
America on the promise of asylum, the same America that commits
my own kind to institutions with routine and rarely second thoughts
signaling the presence of conscience, and while we’re on the subject
of right and wrong, know I’d read the news recently and retreated far
into my unfeeling before I received the blessing of her timely word,
walking in bloody boots through hallways leading to the chambers
where tenderness is said to rest in all of us by symbology, but then
I was called outside my bones again. And let me tell you, my friend:
you’ve never seen light before you’ve seen it. I swear, it’s as if with
the snap of a finger I could recite the very definition of gold without
needing to run yolk from the promise of a child, a happy day’s glow
spilling into the street like July’s laughter from a fire hydrant as we
left the house with folk who loved words and loved us—loved us—
so expansively. And less than two nights later we’re all throwing our
asses in a circle, cuttin’ up, working up what was an effortless sweat,
undeterred even as the music skipped on every hiccup of the fraying
wires, tethered just as strenuously to joy as ever, like always, trying
to catch a good breath, but I paid it no mind, no mind, no mind—no,
I wasn’t absent upstairs exactly, I was hyper-present; what a ghost is
to death I was to life, inside everything simultaneously—the sub and
the synth, the blown-off roof and hole-stomped floor, the rise of
their chests and the fall—and only nigga returned me to this plane:my nigga, my nigga, a lyric left on my bottom lip like the sweet after-
burn of Hennessy, but yo, it’s like I was being called for, called out
of need since I know that word only has such resonance in a world
where we ain’t free. And, nah, we ain’t free, if you were wondering.
There are no shackles on me your eyes can see but none that I can’t
feel as if they were appendages divided from me by the occurrence
of civil war, a set of chimeless chains that could be yanked on and
bring me, even at my most upright, to my knees. And if it happens—
again—I suppose I could pray, there, at my literally lowest moment,
immersed in the mess they’ve made that I’m tasked with cleaning
up for the commendation of pennies. I hope I don’t get shot while
genuflect since that’s apparently a thing now in this country, but I
worry such a selfish ask won’t have sufficient fuel to reach heaven,
that the bastardized sparrow will burn up in the atmosphere as easily
as tissue paper. And I recognize I’m rambling now, but I’m likewise
increasing my odds of bumping into the point of all this since inside
the milk of me something was stirred by what she said, but it’s hard
to translate a muscular language to a verbal one just as it’s hard to
relate to folk who don’t consider their own demise fifty ’leven times
a day at least, and for that relapse not to be an injurious ideation but
an itch of practicality. What I wouldn’t pay for the chance to not pay
attention to every little thing—how they talk near me and how they
talk when they believe I’m nowhere near, what they do or don’t do
with each other that they do or don’t do with me, the questions they
feel quite content to ask me and the ones they never seem to though
I leave the door open, the window, the bleeding heart. I know them
so well, people who wouldn’t know me from the next in the lineup;
I know them so intimately you’d think I love them all, and the gag is
that I do, by some undesired miracle, and that is part of all this, too.
To say they don’t deserve my time is an obvious statement, but they
take it anyway because it’s all they know, evident as I recount every
transgression taking seconds off my time on this earth, summing up
to years, almost to the point I’m gone already, in response to which
I either swallow spit or spit out ellipses. Ask the wounded wall what
I know of restraint, the manifesto I’d pen with what pours out from
my punctured knuckles, though, perhaps, the poet was signaling that,
all along, I’ve been teaching the most important life lesson merely by
domesticating rage, confining it inside the margins of the flesh that
my parents made for me, the page my life is written against each day
in corrective red ink. And this seems like the appropriate moment
to divulge that her sermon came during a dialogue about poetic craft
of all things, but if poetry can’t be applied to how one moves through
this world then I see very little worth in it, which is where it started
for me. Poetry was a dead white thing in my life once, at the bottom
of the trash can with the doll of Jesus they’d tried pawning off on me
back in Catholic school, but luckily I already knew one for us, by us,
and thus found the inner-strength to soldier through the barren winter
of lyrical delight rocking a pair of big-ass Timberlands and other on-
trend threads a person of greater gravitas could’ve filled out better
around the shoulders. But I digress—since what I really mean to be
speaking on is how the Cavalier poets weren’t really doing it for me
during high school, not because their explicit sexuality or their taste
for material excess and ambitious proximity to the throne were such
disagreeable subjects to me, at the time revisiting rap’s mafioso era,
but because when we painted those same pictures as we preferred to,
our tongues spiraling like ballerinas and bullets, they sought the ban
on sale or talked down on it as being absent of any artistic merit, as if
a nation’s worth of people surviving subjugation is more science than
art anyway, for if that were true, then we wouldn’t have a culture and
America wouldn’t have great product to push to the rest of the planet
aside from all the bombs it seems much keener on dropping casually
like Funkmaster Flex, and I’d already grown tired in my young age,
so tired, of trying to prove I’m not stupid even above trying to prove
I’m smart. And those who doubt there’s a difference have digging
to do, deep into their pockets to get me what I’m owed for damages,
for emotional distress and all things it’s been made feasible to sue for
with solid legal representation. Funny, I once longed to be a lawyer,
little fool that I was, my back against a brick wall painted by spotlight,
rifles lined and aiming, in that night’s vision—legal fluency seemed
the only option for release from this burden because it’s the language
my nemeses speak in. I do know bad English from black, but I know
power even better because I’ve brushed up against it just as a person
in any number of neighborhoods around here may have brushed up
against a police officer. Maybe it’s needless to say I didn’t go down
an attorney path; I actually don’t have a plan at all these days except
evading the bullet and also the bullet points corporations thrive on,
as if any of this is simple, as if I, symptom of systemic dysfunctions
enveloped by skeleton and skin, am something simple. I’d only ever
be two-dimensional if airbrushed on a blank T-shirt and even that
would show depth to someone’s esteem for who I was with no one
else nearby, and all this means is that there is more to me or anyone
alike than being menace or miscreant, minstrel or misanthrope, or
murdered as all four would be with equal fanfare. But what I really
want is to know what they feel when their black friend dies in that
typical way for it’s maybe the only thing I don’t know about them,
while we practice poker faces and draft FAQs. Forget seeing eye to
eye for a second. Set aside the particular grammars of forgiveness
we use without pulling up the problem’s root: do they still feel full
people if they put the hammer down? And when they can’t answer,
make note that I can because I have those tools and also others that
shall remain nameless in order to remain purposeful. That’s how I
prefer it, besting all desertions of their decency, which I say since
you’ve caught me rare and raw tonight, sipping off the bottle top,
slurring my songs, hitting my two-step on beat every. single. time.
Damn—how blessed they are to be able to watch me work around
them—as illegibly as what the miraculous Phillis Wheatley wrote
all over her master’s walls, owned in the moment, I feel, solely by
an ambition toward self-definition I also try applying prodigiously,
bringing them to speechlessness, a shaming kind of silence sayinglisten, leave me be because there’s no explaining me, thus there’s
no exploiting me: what only a history under thumb and foot helps
grasp before letting go, for one’s own good even more than mine.

She said my mother would be fine, but did she think it?
The world was a blur of crystal wings and fins.
My tears were casked in crystal, wings and fins.
She was the first of many lady-friends.
The tree shadows shortened, she brought me a drink of water.
Morning matured, she brought me a glass of water.
I drank it so fast, she went and brought another.
I kept looking out the window, she didn’t ask me what for.
I watched out that window, she didn’t ask what for.
The seconds broke off and lay there on the floor.
I imagined my mother’s route, as far as I could.
Her long morning walk, followed as far as I could.
Nothing I could do would do any good.

Everything we do and say in patriarchy can be traced
back to “Strangers in the Night.” Your faded jeans, my
faint daytime smile. (Dazzling’s so expensive.) Bad
Mailer novels; lose-money-quick schemes. A fortune in
friendship, nevertheless. Beef farmers favor self-flesh
awareness. (Or brittle in toffee queen regimes.) Thoughts
as feats of strength. The figure in the woodpile as a
white snake, two needle bites. The end of the week, of
us, strangers now or not? I’m dressed in white, I am the
right blonde in the wrong seaplane, I haven’t learnt the
language yet. The meta-leopards will have taken over
the aquarium. They’ll stroll this way like kangaroos to
green glass. Papa, I’ve upset you. There’ll be a line of
songs like crystals lining up to kiss the bell that says Big
Town. We are on the roof now, playing to Central Park
everyone hot in their coats. Paid for not stolen. They
admit to being too late for miracles, for charity. The
poem’s parents are in the front row. The poem’s friend
interprets. Can we repeat it without going back to the
start, the lover’s demand like ants beneath the plaint?
In Eden, in Athens, estrangement flowers. We turn and
return. Is it love itself, beckoning from the lurid grass-
lands? There’s a cuteness to plaster’s novelty hiding of
the body. People are cited in the mouth, stand on the
ground. They fly like Lucy. You can deny it all for fun
and parties, as if the mind was the feeling that input
gives. It’s a power no one likes to admit, as it so often
leads to failure in later life, like living in a swimming
pool, or losing your tongue in the mail. What of
romances with characters from books? Alice says hello
I remind her of a cookie in a dream she had of heaven or
hell—but which was it? Everything that happens in the
world has someone to say it’s their fault, repress it as
they may. The cutout in the cocktail bar wants to go
home with someone for once. The snakeskin hangs on
the gate like it’s a street corner, that each uttered “baby”
renews. Knowing can be a means to forgetting, also
We stand there as if the floor or wall is our companion
our fortress in trouble: mates a bit longer, keeping sex at
bay. Not everyone looks where they’re going or cares
where others are. They’re the rugged ones, though fleet
as moths when crossing a highway. Sometimes, despite
our own egos, we admire this, as if wise that the pattern
of the one ahead won’t ultimately save or brave us
Don’t rush. The star we wake to mightn’t always be
there, so we wander outside as if air were itself a prayer
or someone’s. Is that for me? addressing an ivy or a wet
plank, suddenly hungry. Tell me what happened to Peter
and Wendy and the loser with the hook for a hand. Was
it all alright in the end? They say time is nothing but it
takes the saying to make it so. To be the one is to
vanquish Sinatra, but also life (not that life is patriarchy)
Repress the possibility for the sake of staying young, as
around the bend a boat may contain the set of problems
that will have always been around. Attitudes to dancing
housework, contraception, ever music’s themes. A wall-
flower may remind themselves of wallpaper, peeling to
reveal a peasant who goes to sleep at dusk behind their
tux, but does that haunt you more than the possibility
of possessing truth? Is that what your glances are about?

Knowing my passion for celebrity nudes reached back to the last days of Netscape Navigator, Siri dutifully told me of the latest gossip site to promise their release.
Lawyers had sued to block the nudes’ coming to light and thereby confirmed they exist, she said. I resented the assured existence of any celebrity nudes I had yet to see, insisting all stars were both clothed and unclothed until the moment the webpage was loaded—at which point truth would be made clear.
Siri disapproved of my inaccurate interest in Schrödinger and his daguerreotype nudes, whose bits I’d heard were coffined up behind some Princeton research paywall full tuition granted access to. She explained I could save my money: how all nudes took form already, stored as light in fiber optic cables stashed in the oceans’ aphotic sands. HTML5 would dredge up everything.
Hypertext did not excite me, but I had to admit pleasure at the thought of seabed celebrity nudes leaked by wolffish. Would they float? Form islands? I saw archipelagos of nudes in a cold Atlantic full of them.
I asked Siri what she thought of my nudes, the lighting I’d used—their dark, private silhouettes. Bring your umbrella, she said. I looked at the thick cloud of my nakedness above, and agreed it was possible for rain.

I saw there were rules, clothes kept dry in plastic bags, phone numbers written inside pants. They also made fire, carved things into the mud. Asked ¿De donde sos vos? I pointed: de allá.

Parents let me do whatever: I looked up at the sun, I loved the sun, it burned a dot in my eyes. Mom was saying we must go catch the bus soon, instead I grabbed a piece of wood & etched it. Sucked it like my own thumb to learn something no one else had. Don’t judge my face. Girls like me. Boys like me with my long hair, I relish it. I love my father very much. More than anybody. He stayed. One morning I come home. He isn’t there. Down the road, this crowd. I drive the crowd away. This is my father, I say. Ask them this thing they allow: his body given to me. I dissect it.

tank rungs and how many waterings left, aside from our drinking.
But you see them where farmhouses were built and lost or condemned
for varying reasons—twin date palms (“fate palms”) thick and robust
and the scrabble of rubble and chimney between. But no habitat of like, just addendum.
Living in a shack there was a single great chestnut, not a walnut, out of place.
A chestnut introduced like a vision of walks, the tessellations
of light collected into prayer, which is where it began for you. And for others.
The mirror of any leaf, the flipside, the reverse, is the growing and falling
enigma—even here among the non-deciduous, dry leaves fall, stroke light.
Whole branches cut off from the supply when sap is difficult to supplement, create.
That vegetation cleared for plantation leaps shadows out of wasted soil, to scaffold.Gardening. I have known so many gardeners who sought
to build hope out of the clearing, to remake an image of plenty,
of sharing fresh air and taking stale breath. Each quietly “oracular,” if in denial,
each afraid of drought though remembering greened light in their plans,
their reticulation, their watching the weather. To make a calm to spread—there if we bother to look, to listen to the birds moving in and out, some staying.
You knew back gardens, and you knew the streets made bare, as they
are here—say, of Melbourne, green-gilled city, whose old planted trees become expendable?
Or where I am, huge chunks of bush grubbed out daily with excuses made
or not bothered with—hard to keep track of outside the shade of verandas, offices.
Or among the palms on another island, Réunion, the warning of offensive odor
though a beauty that might make an activist or remaker of demi-lost verse forms.
What is there in common, across the list of names, of species—growing
conditions, from a part of the world far from where they’re coaxed into a differing
light? What is there in common if we’re not in the place of writing,
and yet we are grown into, welded rhizome by rhizome? You cannot take
the first bird I see today—a yellow-rumped thornbill tuning in, foraging
for the rest of the small flock—any more than I would choose to. It tends the image.
Each cell an art to tempt and let be to rebuild the soil. But no profiling,
and no conflict. The straggly tenuous but tough contradictions of York gums’
outer reaches supple but brittle closer to a perception of where a heart might rest,
termites holding the strings of a pacemaker, split and opening out to tempt owlet nightjars—
I heard one calling from a broken limb at 10:49 the other night and you were still breathing,
sleeping your breath to the canopy of world? That near and far line of prayer.
Once, on a very small island, a coral island big enough for a dozen palms
and a colony of land crabs and two humans, the heart of a young palm
was torn out and handed over to the one unfamiliar with its form or taste.
He ate, and the palm was gone. Coconuts were spouting, finding and making
on the atoll, at the outer. Lugging vats of water up and down the valley wall,
I think this, and your line, a late line: “nothing is missing”—a conclusion?
I wrote of that palmheart for a heart surgeon years ago because all elegies
are entwined, even those of different endocrines. The circulatory system of memorials.
If welcomed under the green light of plantings, the off-spectrum aspiration
against grief, I would have told you of the jam tree—acacia acuminata—
because we are surrounded by them against the odds, and they come back,
thriving on disturbed ground, with trouble around them. Short-lived treeshrubs,
their rough bark exchanges codes of camouflage with stick insects, as I look
now and can’t see beyond the idea of an insect being there, legs forward like antennae.
Rot here is powder rather than mulch, mostly. Saplings rise to spend time dying.
But some pull through and some will become part of the width of those great jarrahs
felled by ancestors, their essences pushing against climate to make good.
My “you” can’t be yours, but the moon and sun do their own syzygy for us all.
Language is vegetation. I knew a couple who screened their cedar kit home
from a country pub with a line then another line and another line of native trees.
I have a family who planted tens of thousands of trees to reclaim saltland settlement
hauled out of its deep sleeping, its subroots. I knew a person who filled empty
paddocks with trees deleted for a new suburb, next to the new suburb where
bushland had hung on against the trend, gone late. To have known morning in those places!
I know you’ll have known this—how thick vegetation, the uprights and bends
of trees on a still morning, can enhance our ability to pick out the between-notes
of birdwork. You wrote of clarity, and translated ornate forms, to be filled with a moment’s
singularity. Respiration. Our greatest breath might be so low or a rasp like a storm
coming in to rejuvenate, to depart with cataclysm. And so we pass with varying
degrees of light, the need for oxygen in the dismantling of carbohydrates.
Night is eating of oxygen. But more, much more out in bare day. So in our sleep
we join the trees, wrapped in leaves and fronds, held out of consciousness by tendrils.
So we thank god for photosynthesis more than we thank god for the sun as itself?
Here, we have valley, we have curved rim of valley closing out, here we have a kite, too—
a black-shouldered kite that hovers above the infrequent powerlines and self-supply,
and here we have year building on year that is an aside to a past that builds in all directions.
The inner green of room cracked in the thermal economics of presence
that underwrites reflection in crops and their residues, a shattering of light
in glassy stubble, the march against concrete and lead, against ordnance
and conquest, just roots holding soil so dry it is tempted to lift as a plume
across the district, hungering after the great dust devil that took off a roof
and opened a house down near Picnic Hill Road not long after you passed.
Interior of wood of fallen branch of loosened fibers and machines striking out
from gravel shoulders to lay great flooded gums on creek beds a trickle of old seasons
green with algae, green with signatures of flow, the bridges where great roots held sway.
What remakes such wasted soil? We try local species and intertwine with olive trees.
And in our suppressed thoughts, palmistry is a lush future of shade and flycatchers
maintaining the relationship between mosquitoes and moisture. No toxins; no anti-growth.
Our night-lights out here stick out sharp—sore thumb exposure, a failure of perspective
of what is lured to the hot light. Mouth dry. We go away too and bring places
back in descriptions but we won’t let them set root—they grow inside and reach
no light, this bright light that weakens accustoming eyes over time, straining
to pick out moss from lichen, which shields the granite boulders it breaks down.
Gradient cuts underfoot the echidna following termite galleries, interstices
of plumbed surface-sounds. We go back to the records, the old books, which are young
and would replace those earlier cuckoo sounds, the kickings-out in nests, the breaking
through of secret chambers—all here, too, like birth, but with an unanswered history,
or partially echoed and not fully addressed. This stuff we do with our souls to adjust
the fragments of bush to whose maps? To miss the kangaroo trail though it’s before our eyes,
or the path of an elusive rain, or a lake whose existence you might request, hint at, question?
Diverse as the air after war is gone but we still can’t breathe so something slips
or grafts. The stain. We rely on such conservancy, on gestures of repair and renewal
that regenerate, to sustain with hands-off learning to let be, to live alongside,
harvest no more than needs be. Such need manifests. Such sleep of passing
is the caveat, is the covenant is the testament of work that rains without a cloud in the sky.
Memorandum of walk of planting of tending: crowbar to break soil or soft cell, either way.
Mostly, people search for pathways to exemptions
so they can cut down protected trees. Mostly, people
search for ways to get around those thin laws so they
can bring down an old system of life. But here, too, we
want to keep the trees going against the trend of felling,
to give breath to those who stifle the art of growth.
Pollination with the grain to grow canopy
and mark place in shades of green—dry here to reflect
from fool’s gold but grow gnarled out of off-red dirt we coax with seedlings
if rain sets green-inflected light you nurtured far from here, far where necessities
work outside the poem for each better-suited frond of palm frond, a eucalypt trunk,
any particular roots. Dry wet dry. Making growth to suit a soil’s recovery.

For Steve



                         Remember when we almost drowned in ’03, the woods
            so thick we only knew the rainstorm by sound of thunder
and violence of the creek, how every day I’d take you to the Stop-N-Go
                         for your case of Natty Lights? Think back to summertime,
            when after lunch you’d pull your shirt off and wring it in your hands
and count off one beer, wring some more, two beers, how in July you’d sweat
                         all the way through last night’s binge. Think back to when
            we chopped paths across hardwood bottoms for skidders to plow
makeshift roads for Justiss Oil pumpjacks to suck black snot the earth
                         doesn’t blow. I wanted to call in sick every day, to feel
            the sunrise through my bedroom pane instead of the company truck’s
windshield. But this isn’t about that. What was I? Eighteen? Drinking
                         creamy coffee the color of soupy dishwater, the callouses
            of my hands sanding the white Styrofoam cup, whiskey from a flask
stirred into yours. I grew to welcome the start of a day filing blades, the rhythm
                         I’d find scraping down, down, up and over. I didn’t care
            like you did for squaring drill sites with double-knots of orange flagging
for the loggers, how we kneeled, panting in the dirt, how you would pan your head
                          to take inventory of the beech and white oaks rooted inside
            the flagged-off square. I don’t know what it mattered, Steve,
which tree we marked for loggers to fell, which sapling we ourselves chopped
                         with machetes. Did the thicket not return what we gave?
            Did the thorn limbs and briars not cut your flesh into estuaries
of brackish pink creeks of sweat and blood? Nothing changes much,
                         does it, Steve? I’m filing a brush hook’s edge for the first time
            in years and still hear you yelling at me, Not like that, Smith. Just give
that damn thing to me.",Cody Smith,"Living,Death,Sorrow & Grieving,Activities,Jobs & Working,Relationships,Friends & Enemies,Nature,Trees & Flowers"

From the winds that scheme to dry
every drop of moisture at dawn, they gather
seeds, lodged between their hooves.
Everywhere they trot, they leave behind
seeds, hoping that their grass-blades
will knife the knolls into pillows
when they sense other eyes prowling
for a kill. Then they shoot straight up,
their legs stiff with hiding quivers,
their backs arch upward, bridging
their shoulders and tails hanging limp,
as they drop their heads straight down,
their bodies shimmering like mirages
punching everyone’s eyes out.
They are too vibrant for slaughter.

At night stories tiptoe with them.
No one ever records them. Not even the winds.
They are small, but secrets nurture them.
Their noses have learned the scent of lies.
Hunters keep marking their hiding places
with their piss. The gazelles case their borders.
They see things that inspire legends.
The glint of moon in black eyes staring at them
from the bush, calculating whether to shoot.
The stunned cackle of teeth when gazelles sail
en masse over clouds of dust, cracks of heat,
our bodies snapping the neck of death.
But most of the time they simply watch.
Their limbs, dexterous and inured to danger,
twitch dreams of unmarked countries.

Gazelles know all about cheetahs.
They’ve learned from their mothers
the art of zigzagging, the power of surprise.
Leaves of succulence bid them closer. Distant
flicker of shadow, spots, ringed tail alerts them.
Their breaths murmur the scent of cat, now.
They scatter: a crater of half-chewed leaves,
dung, and flies flailing in his lightning wind
thundering from behind the scruffy bush.
They coagulate like veins galloping from his heart
of hunger, those cold eyes of cat sleeking speed,
until they twist abruptly, sideways, their necks
barely whisking the nick of his fangs and claw.
Changing tempo and direction, their hooves are staccato
music driving him to exhaustion. They pronk.
