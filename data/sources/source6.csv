I Wandered Lonely As A Cloud (Daffodils) ,I wandered lonely as a cloud|That floats on high o'er vales and hills||When all at once I saw a crowd||A host| of golden daffodils;|Beside the lake| beneath the trees||Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.|Continuous as the stars that shine|And twinkle on the milky way||They stretched in never-ending line|Along the margin of a bay:|Ten thousand saw I at a glance||Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.|The waves beside them danced; but they|Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:|A poet could not but be gay||In such a jocund company:|I gazed- and gazed- but little thought|What wealth the show to me had brought:|For oft| when on my couch I lie|In vacant or in pensive mood||They flash upon that inward eye|Which is the bliss of solitude;|And then my heart with pleasure fills||And dances with the daffodils.,Wordsworth William,lonely
Lonely Am I ,Lonely are the nights|Lonely are the days|Lonely am I| in so many ways|Lonely are the seasons|Lonely are the years|So lonely am I| that it brings tears.|Lonely is this place|Lonely is my life|Lonely am I| that I reach for a knife|Lonely is this court room|Lonely is my sentence|So lonely am I that I ask for repentance.,foulk jim,lonely
A Thought For A Lonely Death,IF God compel thee to this destiny||To die alone| with none beside thy bed|To ruffle round with sobs thy last word said|And mark with tears the pulses ebb from thee|--|Pray then alone| ' O Christ| come tenderly !|By thy forsaken Sonship in the red|Drear wine-press|--by the wilderness out-spread|--|And the lone garden where thine agony|Fell bloody from thy brow|--by all of those|Permitted desolations| comfort mine !|No earthly friend being near me| interpose|No deathly angel 'twixt my face aud thine||But stoop Thyself to gather my life's rose||And smile away my mortal to Divine ! ',Browning Barrett,lonely
Lonely Is Just One Word ,Lonely is just one word chosen to represent so much|To tell of feelings inside that the senses cannot touch|Lonely can be in the teardrops on a bereaved person’s cheek|Lonely can be in the silence of sorrows too deep to speak|Lonely can haunt a deserted room that Laughter once made proud|Lonely surrounds you when you’re alone or finds you in a crowd|Lonely is heard in echoed footsteps of a departing friend|Lonely penetrates the solitude of nights that will not end|Lonely will not listen to the pleadings of a broken heart|Lonely stays and torments until new Love shatters it apart,Havran Mary,lonely
The Lonely Soul ,The lonely soul wanders|Alone in the walks of life|No other soul as his companion|The lonely soul wanders|Alone in the daybreak|He does his duties|In the walks of life|The lonely soul wanders|Alone in the life|He meets many other souls|Who comes to be|Unfit for the lonely soul|The lonely soul wanders|As the days pass by|The lonely soul became|More lonely| with no other|souls as his companion|The lonely soul wanders|Alone in the walks of life|The lonely soul decides|Not to die| but to face|Life in all its hardships|The lonely soul wanders,thermadam anto,lonely
The Stars Go Over The Lonely Ocean ,Unhappy about some far off things|That are not my affair| wandering|Along the coast and up the lean ridges||I saw in the evening|The stars go over the lonely ocean||And a black-maned wild boar|Plowing with his snout on Mal Paso Mountain.|The old monster snuffled| "Here are sweet roots||Fat grubs| slick beetles and sprouted acorns.|The best nation in Europe has fallen||And that is Finland||But the stars go over the lonely ocean|"|The old black-bristled boar||Tearing the sod on Mal Paso Mountain.|"The world's in a bad way| my man||And bound to be worse before it mends;|Better lie up in the mountain here|Four or five centuries||While the stars go over the lonely ocean|"|Said the old father of wild pigs||Plowing the fallow on Mal Paso Mountain.|"Keep clear of the dupes that talk democracy|And the dogs that talk revolution||Drunk with talk| liars and believers.|I believe in my tusks.|Long live freedom and damn the ideologies|"|Said the gamey black-maned boar|Tusking the turf on Mal Paso Mountain.|Submitted by Holt,Jeffers Robinson,lonely
The Lonely Street ,School is over. It is too hot|to walk at ease. At ease|in light frocks they walk the streets|to while the time away.|They have grown tall. They hold|pink flames in their right hands.|In white from head to foot||with sidelong| idle look--|in yellow| floating stuff||black sash and stockings--|touching their avid mouths|with pink sugar on a stick--|like a carnation each holds in her hand--|they mount the lonely street.,Williams Carlos,lonely
Lover's Gifts Lvi: The Evening Was Lonely ,The evening was lonely for me| and I was reading a book till my|heart became dry| and it seemed to me that beauty was a thing|fashioned by the traders in words. Tired I shut the book and|snuffed the candle. In a moment the room was flooded with|moonlight.|Spirit of Beauty| how could you| whose radiance overbrims the|sky| stand hidden behind a candle's tiny flame? How could a few|vain words from a book rise like a mist| and veil her whose voice|has hushed the heart of earth into ineffable calm?,Tagore Rabindranath,lonely
Speak Of The North! A Lonely Moor ,Speak of the North! A lonely moor|Silent and dark and tractless swells||The waves of some wild streamlet pour|Hurriedly through its ferny dells.|Profoundly still the twilight air||Lifeless the landscape; so we deem|Till like a phantom gliding near|A stag bends down to drink the stream.|And far away a mountain zone||A cold| white waste of snow-drifts lies||And one star| large and soft and lone||Silently lights the unclouded skies.,Brontë Charlotte,lonely
You Wander As A Lonely ,Each day you wake up with a frown|Rumours keep spreading around town|That you’re suffering a mental breakdown|A solitary walk you walk|A lonely talk you talk|As you wander as a lonely|You wander as a lonely at night|You wander as a lonely on sight|You wander as a lonely at day|You wander as a lonely and pray|You wander as a lonely each day|Slow down| slow down|Shut down| shut down|Shutdown the lonely before you drown|Embrace your friends with warmth|They can give you assistance|Deliver you from your lonely existence|You keep fighting love|Bending it around like a curve|With your glowering face|Reserving only a lonely place||Halting happiness to arrive in your life|Do you ever stop to wonder?|Do you ever stop to ponder?|Are you the reason for the lonely blunders?|Slow down| slow down|Shut down| shut down|Remove from your head that lonely crown|You wander endlessly as a lonely|Searching for a spot called homely|But your face is missing that vital smile called lovely|Copyright 2006 - Sylvia Chidi|www.sylviachidi.com|Check out my latest 'Justice & If I were a girl',Chidi Sylvia,lonely
One Lonely Afternoon ,Since the fern can't go to the sink for a drink of|water| I graciously submit myself to the task| bringing two|glasses from the sink.|And so we sit| the fern and I| sipping water together.|Of course I'm more complex than a fern| full of deep|thoughts as I am. But I lay this aside for the easy company|of an afternoon friendship.|I don't mind sipping water with a fern| even though||had I my druthers| I'd be speeding through the sky for|Stockholm| sipping a bloody mary with a wedge of lime.|And so we sit one lonely afternoon sipping water|together. The fern looking out of its fronds| and I| looking|out of mine . . .,Edson Russell,lonely
Are You Lonely Tonight? ,Are you lonely tonight|Because your heart was broken?|Are you lonely tonight||Shedding tears from all the emotion?|Please don't be shy.|Just tell me if its okay for me to dropp by.|I'll be the man you've always dreamed of.|I'll hold you close to me and show you love.|I'll help you through your pain and sorrow.|And after you wake up tomorrow||We'll take a walk near the ocean shore.|As time goes by| I'll love you more and more.,Fleischer Jeff,lonely
O So Lonely ,O So Lonely|Are the days gone by.|When others enter your life|Then you push them by.|O So Lonely|When you were in control.|To love them or leave them|You were ever so bold.|O So Lonely|While you sit alone.|No one is there|To make your house a home.|O So Lonely|After all the hearts you break.|Did you ever think it was you|Who you'd really forsake?|O So Lonely|When life was just a dare.|You didn't take time to love|You didn't try to care.|O So Lonely|Have you learned the rule?|That its not just about you|But it does take two.|O So Lonely|Why sit and contemplate?|While others enjoy life|Its never too late.,Weir Cecelia,lonely

The Lonely God ,So Eden was deserted| and at eve|Into the quiet place God came to grieve.|His face was sad| His hands hung slackly down|Along his robe; too sorrowful to frown|He paced along the grassy paths and through|The silent trees| and where the flowers grew|Tended by Adam. All the birds had gone|Out to the world| and singing was not one|To cheer the lonely God out of His grief --|The silence broken only when a leaf|Tapt lightly on a leaf| or when the wind||Slow-handed| swayed the bushes to its mind.|And so along the base of a round hill||Rolling in fern| He bent His way until|He neared the little hut which Adam made||And saw its dusky rooftree overlaid|With greenest leaves. Here Adam and his spouse|Were wont to nestle in their little house|Snug at the dew-time: here He| standing sad||Sighed with the wind| nor any pleasure had|In heavenly knowledge| for His darlings twain|Had gone from Him to learn the feel of pain||And what was meant by sorrow and despair| --|Drear knowledge for a Father to prepare.|There he looked sadly on the little place;|A beehive round it was| without a trace|Of occupant or owner; standing dim|Among the gloomy trees it seemed to Him|A final desolation| the last word|Wherewith the lips of silence had been stirred.|Chaste and remote| so tiny and so shy||So new withal| so lost to any eye||So pac't of memories all innocent|Of days and nights that in it had been spent|In blithe communion| Adam| Eve| and He||Afar from Heaven and its gaudery;|And now no more! He still must be the God|But not the friend; a Father with a rod|Whose voice was fear| whose countenance a threat||Whose coming terror| and whose going wet|With penitential tears; not evermore|Would they run forth to meet Him as before|With careless laughter| striving each to be|First to His hand and dancing in their glee|To see Him coming -- they would hide instead|At His approach| or stand and hang the head||Speaking in whispers| and would learn to pray|Instead of asking| 'Father| if we may.'|Never again to Eden would He haste|At cool of evening| when the sun had paced|Back from the tree-tops| slanting from the rim|Of a low cloud| what time the twilight dim|Knit tree to tree in shadow| gathering slow|Till all had met and vanished in the flow|Of dusky silence| and a brooding star|Stared at the growing darkness from afar||While haply now and then some nested bird|Would lift upon the air a sleepy word|Most musical| or swing its airy bed|To the high moon that drifted overhead.|'Twas good to quit at evening His great throne||To lay His crown aside| and all alone|Down through the quiet air to stoop and glide|Unkenned by angels: silently to hide|In the green fields| by dappled shades| where brooks|Through leafy solitudes and quiet nooks|Flowed far from heavenly majesty and pride||From light astounding and the wheeling tide|Of roaring stars. Thus does it ever seem|Good to the best to stay aside and dream|In narrow places| where the hand can feel|Something beside| and know that it is real.|His angels! silly creatures who could sing|And sing again| and delicately fling|The smoky censer| bow and stand aside|All mute in adoration: thronging wide||Till nowhere could He look but soon He saw|An angel bending humbly to the law|Mechanic; knowing nothing more of pain||Than when they were forbid to sing again||Or swing anew the censer| or bow down|In humble adoration of His frown.|This was the thought in Eden as He trod --|. . . It is a lonely thing to be a God.|So long! afar through Time He bent His mind||For the beginning| which He could not find||Through endless centuries and backwards still|Endless forever| till His 'stonied will|Halted in circles| dizzied in the swing|Of mazy nothingness. -- His mind could bring|Not to subjection| grip or hold the theme|Whose wide horizon melted like a dream|To thinnest edges. Infinite behind|The piling centuries were trodden blind|In gulfs chaotic -- so He could not see|When He was not who always had To Be.|Not even godly fortitude can stare|Into Eternity| nor easy bear|The insolent vacuity of Time:|It is too much| the mind can never climb|Up to its meaning| for| without an end||Without beginning| plan| or scope| or trend|To point a path| there nothing is to hold|And steady surmise: so the mind is rolled|And swayed and drowned in dull Immensity.|Eternity outfaces even Me|With its indifference| and the fruitless year|Would swing as fruitless were I never there.|And so for ever| day and night the same||Years flying swiftly nowhere| like a game|Played random by a madman| without end|Or any reasoned object but to spend|What is unspendable -- Eternal Woe!|O Weariness of Time that fast or slow|Goes never further| never has in view|An ending to the thing it seeks to do||And so does nothing: merely ebb and flow||From nowhere into nowhere| touching so|The shores of many stars and passing on||Careless of what may come or what has gone.|O solitude unspeakable! to be|For ever with oneself! never see|An equal face| or feel an equal hand||To sit in state and issue reprimand||Admonishment or glory| and to smile|Disdaining what has happenèd the while!|O to be breast to breast against a foe!|Against a friend! to strive and not to know|The laboured outcome: love nor be aware|How much the other loved| and greatly care|With passion for that happy love or hate||Nor know what joy or dole was hid in fate.|For I have ranged the spacy width and gone|Swift north and south| striving to look upon|An ending somewhere. Many days I sped|Hard to the west| a thousand years I fled|Eastwards in fury| but I could not find|The fringes of the Infinite. Behind|And yet behind| and ever at the end|Came new beginnings| paths that did not wend|To anywhere were there: and ever vast|And vaster spaces opened -- till at last|Dizzied with distance| thrilling to a pain|Unnameable| I turned to Heaven again.|And there My angels were prepared to fling|The cloudy incense| there prepared to sing|My praise and glory -- O| in fury I|Then roared them senseless| then threw down the sky|And stamped upon it| buffeted a star|With my great fist| and flung the sun afar:|Shouted My anger till the mighty sound|Rung to the width| frighting the furthest bound|And scope of hearing: tumult vaster still||Throning the echo| dinned My ears| until|I fled in silence| seeking out a place|To hide Me from the very thought of Space.|And so| He thought| in Mine own Image I|Have made a man| remote from Heaven high|And all its humble angels: I have poured|My essence in his nostrils: I have cored|His heart with My own spirit; part of Me||His mind with laboured growth unceasingly|Must strive to equal Mine; must ever grow|By virtue of My essence till he know|Both good and evil through the solemn test|Of sin and retribution| till| with zest||He feels his godhead| soars to challenge Me|In Mine own Heaven for supremacy.|Through savage beasts and still more savage clay||Invincible| I bid him fight a way|To greater battles| crawling through defeat|Into defeat again: ordained to meet|Disaster in disaster; prone to fall||I prick him with My memory to call|Defiance at his victor and arise|With anguished fury to his greater size|Through tribulation| terror| and despair.|Astounded| he must fight to higher air||Climb battle into battle till he be|Confronted with a flaming sword and Me.|So growing age by age to greater strength||To greater beauty| skill and deep intent:|With wisdom wrung from pain| with energy|Nourished in sin and sorrow| he will be|Strong| pure and proud an enemy to meet||Tremendous on a battle-field| or sweet|To walk by as friend with candid mind.|--Dear enemy or friend so hard to find||I yet shall find you| yet shall put My breast|In enmity or love against your breast:|Shall smite or clasp with equal ecstasy|The enemy or friend who grows to Me.|The topmost blossom of his growing I|Shall take unto Me| cherish and lift high|Beside myself upon My holy throne: --|It is not good for God to be alone.|The perfect woman of his perfect race|Shall sit beside Me in the highest place|And be my Goddess| Queen| Companion| Wife||The rounder of My majesty| the life|Of My ambition. She will smile to see|Me bending down to worship at her knee|Who never bent before| and she will say||'Dear God| who was it taught Thee how to pray?"|And through eternity| adown the slope|Of never-ending time| compact of hope||Of zest and young enjoyment| I and She|Will walk together| sowing jollity|Among the raving stars| and laughter through|The vacancies of Heaven| till the blue|Vast amplitudes of space lift up a song||The echo of our presence| rolled along|And ever rolling where the planets sing|The majesty and glory of the King.|Then conquered| thou| Eternity| shalt lie|Under My hand as little as a fly.|I am the Master: I the mighty God|And you My workshop. Your pavilions trod|By Me and Mine shall never cease to be||For you are but the magnitude of Me||The width of My extension| the surround|Of My dense splendour. Rolling| rolling round||To steeped infinity| and out beyond|My own strong comprehension| you are bond|And servile to My doings. Let you swing|More wide and ever wide| you do but fling|Around the instant Me| and measure still|The breadth and proportion of My Will.|Then stooping to the hut -- a beehive round --|God entered in and saw upon the ground|The dusty garland| Adam| (learned to weave)|Had loving placed upon the head of Eve|Before the terror came| when joyous they|Could look for God at closing of the day|Profound and happy. So the Mighty Guest|Rent| took| and placed the blossoms in His breast.|'This|' said He gently| 'I shall show My queen|When she hath grown to Me in space serene||And say "'twas worn by Eve."' So| smiling fair||He spread abroad His wings upon the air.,Stephens James,lonely
The Strength Of The Lonely ,(What the Mendicant Said )|The moon's a monk| unmated||Who walks his cell| the sky.|His strength is that of heaven-vowed men|Who all life's flames defy.|They turn to stars or shadows||They go like snow or dew—|Leaving behind no sorrow—|Only the arching blue.,Lindsay Vachel,lonely
A Lonely Tear ,A lonely tear falls down|A smile turns to frown|Trickles down the cheek|Does not make you weak|A lonely tear escapes|A lifetime of mistakes|A sad and lonely heart|Others broke apart|A lonely tear is dried|So many nights it cried|A friend reached out their hand|And tried to understand|The lonely tear is gone|Life will carry on|With love from a friend|The lonely tears will end,Dugan Megan,lonely
My Sweet| Lonely| Little| World ,Come| step|into my sweet| lonely little world!|Hand in hand||We shall run across the cliffs|against which my emotions crash||Fly through the capricious clouds|Through which my wild fancies fly||Swim in the deep waters of the sea|in which lie buried the secrets of my heart||Sing and dance|to the music of the swaying plants and the whistling winds||and when weary and hungry||eat the Forbidden Fruit.........|But perhaps you would wish to run away||Perhaps you have your own sweet| lonely little world......|But first||Come| step|into my sweet| lonely little world!,Chatterjee Jasbir,lonely
Lonely Cowboy ,It's been another long day|in the saddle| and|my back and my butt|both hurt.|Cattle millin' and|dust a'rising||ropin' and draggin' and brandin'|make a long day's work.|So the campfire looks good||with coffee bubblin' away||and the food| and my blanket|are a'callin' to me.|But when I lie down||before I close my eyes||I long for home fires||and my bed| and you.,Treat Scarlett,lonely

Lonely Burial ,There were not many at that lonely place||Where two scourged hills met in a little plain.|The wind cried loud in gusts| then low again.|Three pines strained darkly| runners in a race|Unseen by any. Toward the further woods|A dim harsh noise of voices rose and ceased.|-- We were most silent in those solitudes --|Then| sudden as a flame| the black-robed priest||The clotted earth piled roughly up about|The hacked red oblong of the new-made thing||Short words in swordlike Latin -- and a rout|Of dreams most impotent| unwearying.|Then| like a blind door shut on a carouse||The terrible bareness of the soul's last house.,Benet Vincent,lonely
Love Is Never Lonely ,I want to show you rainbows|and feel your soft touch on my cheek|when they bring tears to my eyes.|I want to whisper my love to you in the morning|when everything and everyone sleeps|for silence will not harbor lies.|I want to hear your voice when I'm not with you|as if it were my own thoughts|and love was never alone.|I want to see in your eyes the truth inside me|so that everyday that I question|I can look at you and know.|I want to take your loneliness|and paint it over with bright memories|till only love is in view.|Should the stars appear for just one night every thousand years|I would wait a lonely eternity|to see them with just you.,Sage TP,lonely
The Lonely Woman ,WHERE the ironbarks are hanging leaves disconsolate and pale||Where the wild vines o’er the ranges their spilt cream of blossom trail||By the door of the bark humpey| by the rotting blood-wood gates||On the river-bound selection| there a lonely woman waits||Waits and watches gilded sunrise glow behind the mountain peak||Hears the water hens’ shrill piping| in the rushes by the creek||And by the sullen stormy sunsets| when the anxious cattle call||Sees the everlasting gum-trees closing round her like a wall.|With the hunger of her bosom notes the wild birds seek their mates||All alone and heavy-hearted| there the lonely woman waits.|Where the tall brown city buildings loom against a cloud-flecked sky||Where along the curving tramlines brightly varnished cars rush by||Where the call of petty traders echoes down the dusty street||And forever comes the beating of the many passing feet||Where the bamboo reeds are whispering by the green park’s iron gates||By the muslin-curtained window| there a lonely woman waits.|Where the white caps lash the sea-wall| and the great waves thunder by||Where the grey rains sweep the beaches underneath a sodden sky||Where the swift-winged gull flies landward| and the fisher bides at home||When the long Pacific reaches are a seething stretch of foam||Where the empty boat drifts seawards| by the ocean’s sand-flanked gates||In the weather-boarded cottage| there a lonely woman waits.|Where the river boats are calling| where the railway engine shrieks||Or where only wild bird liltings echo from the reedy creeks||Where the grey waves grieve to landward| and a wet wind beats the seas||Or where pearl-white moths flit slowly through the dropping wattle-trees||By the high verandah pillars| by the rotting bloodwood gates||Crowded town or dreary seaboard| everywhere some woman waits!,Forrest Mabel,lonely
The Lonely Death ,In the cold I will rise| I will bathe|In waters of ice; myself|Will shiver| and shrive myself||Alone in the dawn| and anoint|Forehead and feet and hands;|I will shutter the windows from light||I will place in their sockets the four|Tall candles and set them aflame|In the grey of the dawn; and myself|Will lay myself straight in my bed||And draw the sheet under my chin.,Crapsey Adelaide,lonely

A Lonely Heart In A Thunderstorm ,A lonely heart sets the table but is she a Milly||a Betty or a Mabel. Tea| coffee| cakes and ale|but outside there blows a gale. Sash cord windows|rattling like chains| thunder and lighting tormenting her|brains. A frail old lady who always lays up for tea but no|one comes not even her family. As the rain pours down she|gives a little frown as she looks at a photo in her wedding|gown. A picture of love on her wedding day| a day she|never wanted to go away.Now all that's forgotton as the|clouds roll together| will her lonely heart stand up to this|gale force weather. She draws the curtains and says|goodnight to the storm then sits by the fire where its|cosy and warm.|No visitors tonight she says to the cat who lay curled up|on the fireside mat. Again she views her wedding day and|asks the Lord to show her the way.Then she holds the cat|to her lonely heart so that they will never be apart. The dear|old lady died that night and the cat now sits on her burial site.,spencer sylvia,lonely

On The Lonely Side Of Town ,On the lonely side of town|When no one else is around|Her brown eyes cry those tears|Over her loves from the past years|Her heart is breaking without a sound|On the lonely side of town|She feels just like a clown|With tears pouring from her eyes|With no rhymn or reason why|But life has turned her upside down|On the lonely side of town|Her head is hanging down|Shaking from side to side|With not much left of her pride|There on that lonely side of town|On the lonely side of town|She is lost behind her frown|But in ways she may never know|Her love fine it's way to show|And by her love she is bound|On the lonely side of town|You can hear the old train sound|Reminding her of those days|When life glowed with brighter rays|Even on that lonely side of town|On the lonely side of town|She is loved by leaps and bounds|Even though she may not see|Love'S the only thing that's free|And it creaps up on her without a sound,hale norman,lonely
Noble Lonely ,Loneliness is pure and independent|Original and creative|Struggle is noble|And the most corrupt thing in life|Is a group going the wrong way|Not the single struggling soul,oke maggie,lonely
Lonely In The World ,I am lonely in the world||Trying to cry||But no tears are coming out||Noone else is here to hold me not even my parents||Trying to forget my past||As I start over||In my lonely world.,helms christina,lonely
The Lonely Angel ,The lonely Angel cries to herself||Her head is hung low and her body is still||She calls out into to darkness and hears her voice echo||But there is no one else in her empty world||She locks herself in afraid of what might happen||Closes the illusive curtains and shuts the door to her feelings||Her beautiful face has grown old with crying||The perfect smile painted on her lips has been wiped off||And her dreams and aspirations have all been erased.|She waits patiently for her walls of solid emotion to tear||Her cares are not for money| power or enlightenment||Instead love and care is all that seeks||Memories whispered gently into her ears is all she has for company||She lays naked with no clothes to protect her||Her prayers are always for a light to guide her||A small crevice created by her hope lets warm air upon her||She sometimes huddles against this unique warmth||And she knows that if she lets go of hope she will be cold forever.,Taylor James,lonely
A Lonely Woman Under Lonely Nights ,A lonely woman under the lonely nights||That mad young woman.,Dubey Kant,lonely
Lonely Eyes ,No one sees and no one tries|to find the pain in lonely eyes|They're strong and bold they hide the tears|that many people cry in years|And yet at night when no one's there|they cry alone but no one cares|Friendless days and last goodbyes|lie in the heart of lonely eyes,Licona Lorraine,lonely
Lonely Vexation.. ,Isolation accompanies me||whispering melodically in my ear..|Confusion is mocking me||with its mirthless smile| it stands near..|The silence that surrounds me..|Speaks of many fears..|and savage loneliness| a glorious creature..|is gnawing me with her teeth.|These beasts that form my world||Are my companions who laugh my way..|promising external continuation||of all this pain i breathe.|Nothing will change| they tell me..|There is no course to improve..!|Truth| hiding in the shadows||fiction| standing bright before my eyes..|Searching| pushing||Nothing is as it seems..|We clamour and we fight..|Making fists at the brightness..|wondering what it is..|who it is.. what it means..|If truth should consume us||If God can live with us..|then why are we soo empty..? ?|Always| with the conundrum of our desires..? ?|Our life..our lackings..? ?|There is darkness| they say..|And there is light..|But sometimes.. fuzzy and faint illuminations.. are all the shades i see..|My life's play is written..|And there are no foot lights..|only actors and actresses..|who are not willing to share the performance..|So i sit alone..|On a dark stage..|without U..! !,Rehani Charvee,lonely
Lonely And Lost ,While every single human rests||and the nightly creatures claim their place||the sweet sound of silence||combines with the profound darkness of the night.|The chilling breeze is unnoticed||The howling of the dogs| ignored||Who's paying attention anyway?|Their dreams are trapping their souls.|In this mistic| magic moment||everything's forgotten||Unconsciousness is everyone's sovereign.|And as stars get brighter||in the dark blue sky||And as the owls chant||their ancient song||He defies the nightly reign||by staying awake.|He doesn't belong to the world||He's an outcast from our own race||Nature rejects him||Darkness loves him||People forget him.|In the middle of his beloved night||between menacing shadows||and flickering lights||He lays down on the cold stone||embraced by silence||heated by loneliness||desiring nothing||expecting no-one.|Immersed in his thoughts||he suddenly realizes the awful truth||'This| is death| lonely| mistic| personal'|'This| is death| absolute solitude'|'This| is death| meaningless| obligatory'|'This| is death| though I'm still alive'|'This| is death| for my soul has already died',ask ever,lonely

Lonely Girl| Lonely Heart ,She curled up on her windowsill||A lonely girl| crying out her heart||For the boy that never loved her||And the friends that just don't care.|She wallows up in her pain||The girl with the lonely heart||The girl with no boy to love||But she didnt see what mattered.|She walked up the hallway| makeup smuged||Tears running| the people they stared.|Untill now| they never knew||She was just a lonely girl| with a lonely heart waiting for someone to love.,Ireland Jacquelyn,lonely
The Lonely Train On The Lonely Track With 24 Coaches Painted Black ,Among the brambles of a shattered heart lies my soul in crags||Among the shambles of life torn apart lies my spirit in rags;|Tears streaming down my face as snakes crawl on my body lifeless|Leaving amigos and flamingos away at the home| oh life pointless.|Ticktock!

A Thing Of Beauty (Endymion) ,A thing of beauty is a joy for ever:|Its lovliness increases; it will never|Pass into nothingness; but still will keep|A bower quiet for us| and a sleep|Full of sweet dreams| and health| and quiet breathing.|Therefore| on every morrow| are we wreathing|A flowery band to bind us to the earth||Spite of despondence| of the inhuman dearth|Of noble natures| of the gloomy days||Of all the unhealthy and o'er-darkn'd ways|Made for our searching: yes| in spite of all||Some shape of beauty moves away the pall|From our dark spirits. Such the sun| the moon||Trees old and young| sprouting a shady boon|For simple sheep; and such are daffodils|With the green world they live in; and clear rills|That for themselves a cooling covert make|'Gainst the hot season; the mid-forest brake||Rich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms:|And such too is the grandeur of the dooms|We have imagined for the mighty dead;|An endless fountain of immortal drink||Pouring unto us from the heaven's brink.,Keats John,beauty

I Died For Beauty ,I died for beauty| but was scarce|Adjusted in the tomb||When one who died for truth was lain|In an adjoining room.|He questioned softly why I failed?|"For beauty|" I replied.|"And I for truth - the two are one;|We brethren are|" he said.|And so| as kinsmen met a-night||We talked between the rooms||Until the moss had reached our lips||And covered up our names.,Dickinson Emily,beauty

Beauty ,WHAT does it mean? Tired| angry| and ill at ease||No man| woman| or child alive could please|Me now. And yet I almost dare to laugh|Because I sit and frame an epitaph-|'Here lies all that no one loved of him|And that loved no one.' Then in a trice that whim|Has wearied. But| though I am like a river|At fall of evening when it seems that never|Has the sun lighted it or warmed it| while|Cross breezes cut the surface to a file||This heart| some fraction of me| hapily|Floats through a window even now to a tree|Down in the misting| dim-lit| quiet vale;|Not like a pewit that returns to wail|For something it has lost| but like a dove|That slants unanswering to its home and love.|There I find my rest| and through the dusk air|Flies what yet lives in me. Beauty is there,Thomas Edward,beauty
Youth And Beauty ,I bought a dishmop--|having no daughter--|for they had twisted|fine ribbons of shining copper|about white twine|and made a tousled head|of it| fastened it|upon a turned ash stick|slender at the neck|straight| tall--|when tied upright|on the brass wallbracket|to be a light for me|and naked|as a girl should seem|to her father.,Williams Carlos,beauty

O Beauty| Passing Beauty! ,O beauty| passing beauty! Sweetest sweet!|How can thou let me waste my youth in sighs?|I only ask to sit beside thy feet.|Thou knowest I dare not look into thine eyes.|Might I but kiss thy hand! I dare not fold|My arms about thee--scarcely dare to speak.|And nothing seems to me so wild and bold||As with one kiss to touch thy blessed cheek.|Methinks if I should kiss thee| no control|Within the thrilling brain could keep afloat|The subtle spirit. Even while I spoke||The bare word "kiss" hath made my inner soul|To tremble like a lute string| ere the note|Hath melted in the silence that it broke.,Tennyson Lord,beauty

He Remembers Forgotten Beauty ,When my arms wrap you round I press|My heart upon the loveliness|That has long faded from the world;|The jewelled crowns that kings have hurled|In shadowy pools| when armies fled;|The love-tales wrought with silken thread|By dreaming ladies upon cloth|That has made fat the murderous moth;|The roses that of old time were|Woven by ladies in their hair||The dew-cold lilies ladies bore|Through many a sacred corridor|Where such grey clouds of incense rose|That only God's eyes did not close:|For that pale breast and lingering hand|Come from a more dream-heavy land||A more dream-heavy hour than this;|And when you sigh from kiss to kiss|I hear white Beauty sighing| too||For hours when all must fade like dew.|But flame on flame| and deep on deep||Throne over throne where in half sleep||Their swords upon their iron knees||Brood her high lonely mysteries.,Yeats Butler,beauty
Genius In Beauty ,Beauty like hers is genius. Not the call|Of Homer's or of Dante's heart sublime| --|Not Michael's hand furrowing the zones of time| --|Is more with compassed mysteries musical;|Nay| not in Spring's Summer's sweet footfall|More gathered gifts exuberant Life bequeaths|Than doth this sovereign face| whose love-spell breathes|Even from its shadowed contour on the wall.|As many men are poets in their youth||But for one sweet-strung soul the wires prolong|Even through all change the indomitable song;|So in likewise the envenomed years| whose tooth|Rends shallower grace with ruin void of truth||Upon this beauty's power shall wreak no wrong.,Rossetti Gabriel,beauty

Beauty ,Say not of beauty she is good||Or aught but beautiful||Or sleek to doves' wings of the wood|Her wild wings of a gull.|Call her not wicked; that word's touch|Consumes her like a curse;|But love her not too much| too much||For that is even worse.|O| she is neither good nor bad||But innocent and wild!|Enshrine her and she dies| who had|The hard heart of a child.,Wylie Morton,beauty
A Hymn In Honour Of Beauty ,Ah whither| Love| wilt thou now carry me?|What wontless fury dost thou now inspire|Into my feeble breast| too full of thee?|Whilst seeking to aslake thy raging fire||Thou in me kindlest much more great desire||And up aloft above my strength dost raise|The wondrous matter of my fire to praise.|That as I erst in praise of thine own name||So now in honour of thy mother dear||An honourable hymn I eke should frame||And with the brightness of her beauty clear||The ravish'd hearts of gazeful men might rear|To admiration of that heavenly light||From whence proceeds such soul-enchanting might.|Thereto do thou| great goddess| queen of beauty||Mother of love| and of all world's delight||Without whose sovereign grace and kindly duty|Nothing on earth seems fair to fleshly sight||Do thou vouchsafe with thy love-kindling light|T' illuminate my dim and dulled eyne||And beautify this sacred hymn of thine:|That both to thee| to whom I mean it most||And eke to her| whose fair immortal beam|Hath darted fire into my feeble ghost||That now it wasted is with woes extreme||It may so please| that she at length will stream|Some dew of grace into my withered heart||After long sorrow and consuming smart.|WHAT time this world's great Workmaster did cast|To make all things such as we now behold||It seems that he before his eyes had plac'd|A goodly pattern| to whose perfect mould|He fashion'd them as comely as he could;|That now so fair and seemly they appear||As nought may be amended anywhere.|That wondrous pattern| wheresoe'er it be||Whether in earth laid up in secret store||Or else in heaven| that no man may it see|With sinful eyes| for fear it to deflore||Is perfect Beauty| which all men adore;|Whose face and feature doth so much excel|All mortal sense| that none the same may tell.|Thereof as every earthly thing partakes|Or more or less| by influence divine||So it more fair accordingly it makes||And the gross matter of this earthly mine||Which clotheth it| thereafter doth refine||Doing away the dross which dims the light|Of that fair beam which therein is empight.|For| through infusion of celestial power||The duller earth it quick'neth with delight||And lifeful spirits privily doth pour|Through all the parts| that to the looker's sight|They seem to please. That is thy sovereign might||O Cyprian queen| which flowing from the beam|Of thy bright star| thou into them dost stream.|That is the thing which giveth pleasant grace|To all things fair| that kindleth lively fire||Light of thy lamp| which| shining in the face||Thence to the soul darts amorous desire||And robs the hearts of those which it admire;|Therewith thou pointest thy son's poison'd arrow||That wounds the life| and wastes the inmost marrow.|How vainly then do idle wits invent||That beauty is nought else but mixture made|Of colours fair| and goodly temp'rament|Of pure complexions| that shall quickly fade|And pass away| like to a summer's shade;|Or that it is but comely composition|Of parts well measur'd| with meet disposition.|Hath white and red in it such wondrous power||That it can pierce through th' eyes unto the heart||And therein stir such rage and restless stour||As nought but death can stint his dolour's smart?|Or can proportion of the outward part|Move such affection in the inward mind||That it can rob both sense and reason blind?|Why do not then the blossoms of the field||Which are array'd with much more orient hue||And to the sense most dainty odours yield||Work like impression in the looker's view?|Or why do not fair pictures like power shew||In which oft-times we nature see of art|Excell'd| in perfect limning every part?|But ah| believe me| there is more than so||That works such wonders in the minds of men;|I| that have often prov'd| too well it know||And whoso list the like assays to ken||Shall find by trial| and confess it then||That beauty is not| as fond men misdeem||An outward shew of things| that only seem.|For that same goodly hue of white and red||With which the cheeks are sprinkled| shall decay||And those sweet rosy leaves| so fairly spread|Upon the lips| shall fade and fall away|To that they were| even to corrupted clay;|That golden wire| those sparkling stars so bright||Shall turn to dust; and lose their goodly light.|But that fair lamp| from whose celestial ray|That light proceeds| which kindleth lovers' fire||Shall never be extinguish'd nor decay;|But when the vital spirits do expire||Unto her native planet shall retire;|For it is heavenly born and cannot die||Being a parcel of the purest sky.|For when the soul| the which derived was||At first| out of that great immortal Spright||By whom all live to love| whilom did pass|Down from the top of purest heaven's height|To be embodied here| it then took light|And lively spirits from that fairest star||Which lights the world forth from his fiery car.|Which power retaining still or more or less||When she in fleshly seed is eft enraced||Through every part she doth the same impress||According as the heavens have her graced||And frames her house| in which she will be placed||Fit for herself| adorning it with spoil|Of th' heavenly riches which she robb'd erewhile.|Thereof it comes that these fair souls| which have|The most resemblance of that heavenly light||Frame to themselves most beautiful and brave|Their fleshly bower| most fit for their delight||And the gross matter by a sovereign might|Tempers so trim| that it may well be seen|A palace fit for such a virgin queen.|So every spirit| as it is most pure||And hath in it the more of heavenly light||So it the fairer body doth procure|To habit in| and it more fairly dight|With cheerful grace and amiable sight.|For of the soul the body form doth take:|For soul is form| and doth the body make.|Therefore wherever that thou dost behold|A comely corpse| with beauty fair endued||Know this for certain| that the same doth hold|A beauteous soul| with fair conditions thewed||Fit to receive the seed of virtue strewed.|For all that fair is| is by nature good;|That is a sign to know the gentle blood.|Yet oft it falls that many a gentle mind|Dwells in deformed tabernacle drown'd||Either by chance| against the course of kind||Or through unaptness in the substance found||Which it assumed of some stubborn ground||That will not yield unto her form's direction||But is deform'd with some foul imperfection.|And oft it falls| (ay me| the more to rue)|That goodly beauty| albe heavenly born||Is foul abus'd| and that celestial hue||Which doth the world with her delight adorn||Made but the bait of sin| and sinners' scorn||Whilst every one doth seek and sue to have it||But every one doth seek but to deprave it.|Yet nathëmore is that fair beauty's blame||But theirs that do abuse it unto ill:|Nothing so good| but that through guilty shame|May be corrupt| and wrested unto will:|Natheless the soul is fair and beauteous still||However flesh{"e}s fault it filthy make;|For things immortal no corruption take.|But ye fair dames| the world's dear ornaments|And lively images of heaven's light||Let not your beams with such disparagements|Be dimm'd| and your bright glory dark'ned quite;|But mindful still of your first country's sight||Do still preserve your first informed grace||Whose shadow yet shines in your beauteous face.|Loathe that foul blot| that hellish firebrand||Disloyal lust| fair beauty's foulest blame||That base affections| which your ears would bland||Commend to you by love's abused name||But is indeed the bondslave of defame;|Which will the garland of your glory mar||And quench the light of your bright shining star.|But gentle Love| that loyal is and true||Will more illumine your resplendent ray||And add more brightness to your goodly hue||From light of his pure fire; which| by like way|Kindled of yours| your likeness doth display;|Like as two mirrors| by oppos'd reflection||Do both express the face's first impression.|Therefore| to make your beauty more appear||It you behoves to love| and forth to lay|That heavenly riches which in you ye bear||That men the more admire their fountain may;|For else what booteth that celestial ray||If it in darkness be enshrined ever||That it of loving eyes be viewed never?|But| in your choice of loves| this well advise||That likest to yourselves ye them select||The which your forms' first source may sympathize||And with like beauty's parts be inly deckt;|For| if you loosely love without respect||It is no love| but a discordant war||Whose unlike parts amongst themselves do jar.|For love is a celestial harmony|Of likely hearts compos'd of stars' concent||Which join together in sweet sympathy||To work each other's joy and true content||Which they have harbour'd since their first descent|Out of their heavenly bowers| where they did see|And know each other here belov'd to be.|Then wrong it were that any other twain|Should in love's gentle band combined be|But those whom Heaven did at first ordain||And made out of one mould the more t' agree;|For all that like the beauty which they see||Straight do not love; for love is not so light|As straight to burn at first beholder's sight.|But they| which love indeed| look otherwise||With pure regard and spotless true intent||Drawing out of the object of their eyes|A more refined form| which they present|Unto their mind| void of all blemishment;|Which it reducing to her first perfection||Beholdeth free from flesh's frail infection.|And then conforming it unto the light||Which in itself it hath remaining still||Of that first Sun| yet sparkling in his sight||Thereof he fashions in his higher skill|An heavenly beauty to his fancy's will;|And it embracing in his mind entire||The mirror of his own thought doth admire.|Which seeing now so inly fair to be||As outward it appeareth to the eye||And with his spirit's proportion to agree||He thereon fixeth all his fantasy||And fully setteth his felicity;|Counting it fairer than it is indeed||And yet indeed her fairness doth exceed.|For lovers' eyes more sharply sighted be|Than other men's| and in dear love's delight|See more than any other eyes can see||Through mutual receipt of beam{"e}s bright||Which carry privy message to the spright||And to their eyes that inmost fair display||As plain as light discovers dawning day.|Therein they see| through amorous eye-glances||Armies of loves still flying to and fro||Which dart at them their little fiery lances;|Whom having wounded| back again they go||Carrying compassion to their lovely foe;|Who| seeing her fair eyes' so sharp effect||Cures all their sorrows with one sweet aspect.|In which how many wonders do they rede|To their conceit| that others never see||Now of her smiles| with which their souls they feed||Like gods with nectar in their banquets free;|Now of her looks| which like to cordials be;|But when her words' embássade forth she sends||Lord| how sweet music that unto them lends.|Sometimes upon her forehead they behold|A thousand graces masking in delight;|Sometimes within her eyelids they unfold|Ten thousand sweet belgards| which to their sight|Do seem like twinkling stars in frosty night;|But on her lips| like rosy buds in May||So many millions of chaste pleasures play.|All those| O Cytherea| and thousands more|Thy handmaids be| which do on thee attend||To deck thy beauty with their dainties' store||That may it more to mortal eyes commend||And make it more admir'd of foe and friend:|That in men's hearts thou may'st thy throne install||And spread thy lovely kingdom over all.|Then Iö| triumph! O great Beauty's Queen||Advance the banner of thy conquest high||That all this world| the which thy vassals bene||May draw to thee| and with due fealty|Adore the power of thy great majesty||Singing this hymn in honour of thy name||Compil'd by me| which thy poor liegeman am.|In lieu whereof grant| O great sovereign||That she whose conquering beauty doth captive|My trembling heart in her eternal chain||One drop of grace at length will to me give||That I her bounden thrall by her may live||And this same life| which first fro me she reaved||May owe to her| of whom I it received.|And you| fair Venus' darling| my dear dread||Fresh flower of grace| great goddess of my life||When your fair eyes these fearful lines shall read||Deign to let fall one drop of due relief||That may recure my heart's long pining grief||And shew what wondrous power your beauty hath||That can restore a damned wight from death.,Spenser Edmund,beauty

Clothed In Beauty ,As if chiseled| a fruit-laden branch|Hangs in my garden| asleep - so low...|The trees sleep - and dream? - in moonlight;|And the mystery of their life is near| near...|Even if we cannot grasp it||The mute language is still intelligible:|They use our beauty to express|How we are one amidst rays and spots of light.|And the tremor of any life's creation|Reveals itself in a lovely form;|And the variance of different things is sweetened|By shared beauty. Multiply it!|And the world will be like this unstirring garden||Where everything heeds a harmonious silence:|Both stem and flower yield to the dear Earth;|Both flower and stem listen to the Moon.,Ivanov Ivanovich,beauty

A Hymn Of Heavenly Beauty ,Rapt with the rage of mine own ravish'd thought||Through contemplation of those goodly sights||And glorious images in heaven wrought||Whose wondrous beauty| breathing sweet delights|Do kindle love in high-conceited sprights;|I fain to tell the things that I behold||But feel my wits to fail| and tongue to fold.|Vouchsafe then| O thou most Almighty Spright||From whom all gifts of wit and knowledge flow||To shed into my breast some sparkling light|Of thine eternal truth| that I may show|Some little beams to mortal eyes below|Of that immortal beauty| there with thee||Which in my weak distraughted mind I see;|That with the glory of so goodly sight|The hearts of men| which fondly here admire|Fair seeming shews| and feed on vain delight||Transported with celestial desire|Of those fair forms| may lift themselves up higher||And learn to love| with zealous humble duty||Th' eternal fountain of that heavenly beauty.|Beginning then below| with th' easy view|Of this base world| subject to fleshly eye||From thence to mount aloft| by order due||To contemplation of th' immortal sky;|Of the soare falcon so I learn to fly||That flags awhile her fluttering wings beneath||Till she herself for stronger flight can breathe.|Then look| who list thy gazeful eyes to feed|With sight of that is fair| look on the frame|Of this wide universe| and therein reed|The endless kinds of creatures which by name|Thou canst not count| much less their natures aim;|All which are made with wondrous wise respect||And all with admirable beauty deckt.|First th' earth| on adamantine pillars founded||Amid the sea engirt with brazen bands;|Then th' air still flitting| but yet firmly bounded|On every side| with piles of flaming brands||Never consum'd| nor quench'd with mortal hands;|And last| that mighty shining crystal wall||Wherewith he hath encompassed this All.|By view whereof it plainly may appear||That still as every thing doth upward tend||And further is from earth| so still more clear|And fair it grows| till to his perfect end|Of purest beauty it at last ascend;|Air more than water| fire much more than air||And heaven than fire| appears more pure and fair.|Look thou no further| but affix thine eye|On that bright| shiny| round| still moving mass||The house of blessed gods| which men call sky||All sow'd with glist'ring stars more thick than grass||Whereof each other doth in brightness pass||But those two most| which ruling night and day||As king and queen| the heavens' empire sway;|And tell me then| what hast thou ever seen|That to their beauty may compared be||Or can the sight that is most sharp and keen|Endure their captain's flaming head to see?|How much less those| much higher in degree||And so much fairer| and much more than these||As these are fairer than the land and seas?|For far above these heavens| which here we see||Be others far exceeding these in light||Not bounded| not corrupt| as these same be||But infinite in largeness and in height||Unmoving| uncorrupt| and spotless bright||That need no sun t' illuminate their spheres||But their own native light far passing theirs.|And as these heavens still by degrees arise||Until they come to their first Mover's bound||That in his mighty compass doth comprise||And carry all the rest with him around;|So those likewise do by degrees redound||And rise more fair; till they at last arrive|To the most fair| whereto they all do strive.|Fair is the heaven where happy souls have place||In full enjoyment of felicity||Whence they do still behold the glorious face|Of the divine eternal Majesty;|More fair is that| where those Ideas on high|Enranged be| which Plato so admired||And pure Intelligences from God inspired.|Yet fairer is that heaven| in which do reign|The sovereign Powers and mighty Potentates||Which in their high protections do contain|All mortal princes and imperial states;|And fairer yet| whereas the royal Seats|And heavenly Dominations are set||From whom all earthly governance is fet.|Yet far more fair be those bright Cherubins||Which all with golden wings are overdight||And those eternal burning Seraphins||Which from their faces dart out fiery light;|Yet fairer than they both| and much more bright||Be th' Angels and Archangels| which attend|On God's own person| without rest or end.|These thus in fair each other far excelling||As to the highest they approach more near||Yet is that highest far beyond all telling||Fairer than all the rest which there appear||Though all their beauties join'd together were;|How then can mortal tongue hope to express|The image of such endless perfectness?|Cease then| my tongue| and lend unto my mind|Leave to bethink how great that beauty is||Whose utmost parts so beautiful I find;|How much more those essential parts of his||His truth| his love| his wisdom| and his bliss||His grace| his doom| his mercy| and his might||By which he lends us of himself a sight.|Those unto all he daily doth display||And shew himself in th' image of his grace||As in a looking-glass| through which he may|Be seen of all his creatures vile and base||That are unable else to see his face||His glorious face which glistereth else so bright||That th' Angels selves cannot endure his sight.|But we| frail wights| whose sight cannot sustain|The sun's bright beams when he on us doth shine||But that their points rebutted back again|Are dull'd| how can we see with feeble eyne|The glory of that Majesty Divine||In sight of whom both sun and moon are dark||Compared to his least resplendent spark?|The means| therefore| which unto us is lent|Him to behold| is on his works to look||Which he hath made in beauty excellent||And in the same| as in a brazen book||To read enregister'd in every nook|His goodness| which his beauty doth declare;|For all that's good is beautiful and fair.|Thence gathering plumes of perfect speculation||To imp the wings of thy high-flying mind||Mount up aloft through heavenly contemplation||From this dark world| whose damps the soul so blind||And| like the native brood of eagles' kind||On that bright Sun of Glory fix thine eyes||Clear'd from gross mists of frail infirmities.|Humbled with fear and awful reverence||Before the footstool of his majesty|Throw thyself down| with trembling innocence||Ne dare look up with corruptible eye|On the dread face of that great Deity||For fear| lest if he chance to look on thee||Thou turn to nought| and quite confounded be.|But lowly fall before his mercy seat||Close covered with the Lamb's integrity|From the just wrath of his avengeful threat|That sits upon the righteous throne on high;|His throne is built upon eternity||More firm and durable than steel or brass||Or the hard diamond| which them both doth pass.|His sceptre is the rod of righteousness||With which he bruiseth all his foes to dust||And the great Dragon strongly doth repress||Under the rigour of his judgement just;|His seat is truth| to which the faithful trust||From whence proceed her beams so pure and bright|That all about him sheddeth glorious light:|Light far exceeding that bright blazing spark|Which darted is from Titan's flaming head||That with his beams enlumineth the dark|And dampish air| whereby all things are read;|Whose nature yet so much is marvelled|Of mortal wits| that it doth much amaze|The greatest wizards which thereon do gaze.|But that immortal light| which there doth shine||Is many thousand times more bright| more clear||More excellent| more glorious| more divine||Through which to God all mortal actions here||And even the thoughts of men| do plain appear;|For from th' eternal truth it doth proceed||Through heavenly virtue which her beams do breed.|With the great glory of that wondrous light|His throne is all encompassed around||And hid in his own brightness from the sight|Of all that look thereon with eyes unsound;|And underneath his feet are to be found|Thunder and lightning and tempestuous fire||The instruments of his avenging ire.|There in his bosom Sapience doth sit||The sovereign darling of the Deity||Clad like a queen in royal robes| most fit|For so great power and peerless majesty||And all with gems and jewels gorgeously|Adorn'd| that brighter than the stars appear||And make her native brightness seem more clear.|And on her head a crown of purest gold|Is set| in sign of highest sovereignty;|And in her hand a sceptre she doth hold||With which she rules the house of God on high||And manageth the ever-moving sky||And in the same these lower creatures all|Subjected to her power imperial.|Both heaven and earth obey unto her will||And all the creatures which they both contain;|For of her fullness which the world doth fill|They all partake| and do in state remain|As their great Maker did at first ordain||Through observation of her high behest||By which they first were made| and still increast.|The fairness of her face no tongue can tell;|For she the daughters of all women's race||And angels eke| in beauty doth excel||Sparkled on her from God's own glorious face||And more increas'd by her own goodly grace||That it doth far exceed all human thought||Ne can on earth compared be to aught.|Ne could that painter (had he lived yet)|Which pictured Venus with so curious quill||That all posterity admired it||Have portray'd this| for all his mast'ring skill;|Ne she herself| had she remained still||And were as fair as fabling wits do feign||Could once come near this beauty sovereign.|But had those wits| the wonders of their days||Or that sweet Teian poet| which did spend|His plenteous vein in setting forth her praise||Seen but a glimpse of this which I pretend||How wondrously would he her face commend||Above that idol of his feigning thought||That all the world should with his rhymes be fraught.|How then dare I| the novice of his art||Presume to picture so divine a wight||Or hope t' express her least perfection's part||Whose beauty fills the heavens with her light||And darks the earth with shadow of her sight?|Ah| gentle Muse| thou art too weak and faint|The portrait of so heavenly hue to paint.|Let angels| which her goodly face behold|And see at will| her sovereign praises sing||And those most sacred mysteries unfold|Of that fair love of mighty heaven's King;|Enough is me t' admire so heavenly thing||And being thus with her huge love possest||In th' only wonder of herself to rest.|But whoso may| thrice happy man him hold||Of all on earth whom God so much doth grace|And lets his own beloved to behold;|For in the view of her celestial face|All joy| all bliss| all happiness| have place;|Ne aught on earth can want unto the wight|Who of herself can win the wishful sight.|For she| out of her secret treasury||Plenty of riches forth on him will pour||Even heavenly riches| which there hidden lie|Within the closet of her chastest bower||Th' eternal portion of her precious dower||Which mighty God hath given to her free||And to all those which thereof worthy be.|None thereof worthy be| but those whom she|Vouchsafeth to her presence to receive||And letteth them her lovely face to see||Whereof such wondrous pleasures they conceive||And sweet contentment| that it doth bereave|Their soul of sense| through infinite delight||And them transport from flesh into the spright.|In which they see such admirable things||As carries them into an ecstasy||And hear such heavenly notes| and carollings|Of God's high praise| that fills the brazen sky;|And feel such joy and pleasure inwardly||That maketh them all worldly cares forget||And only think on that before them set.|Ne from thenceforth doth any fleshly sense||Or idle thought of earthly things| remain;|But all that erst seem'd sweet seems now offence||And all that pleased erst now seems to pain;|Their joy| their comfort| their desire| their gain||Is fixed all on that which now they see;|All other sights but feigned shadows be.|And that fair lamp| which useth to inflame|The hearts of men with self-consuming fire|Thenceforth seems foul| and full of sinful blame;|And all that pomp to which proud minds aspire|By name of honour| and so much desire||Seems to them baseness| and all riches dross||And all mirth sadness| and all lucre loss.|So full their eyes are of that glorious sight||And senses fraught with such satiety||That in nought else on earth they can delight||But in th' aspect of that felicity||Which they have written in their inward eye;|On which they feed| and in their fastened mind|All happy joy and full contentment find.|Ah| then| my hungry soul| which long hast fed|On idle fancies of thy foolish thought||And| with false beauty's flatt'ring bait misled||Hast after vain deceitful shadows sought||Which all are fled| and now have left thee nought|But late repentance through thy follies prief;|Ah cease to gaze on matter of thy grief:|And look at last up to that sovereign light||From whose pure beams all perfect beauty springs||That kindleth love in every godly sprite||Even the love of God| which loathing brings|Of this vile world and these gay-seeming things;|With whose sweet pleasures being so possest||Thy straying thoughts henceforth for ever rest.,Spenser Edmund,beauty
Sonnet 54: O| How Much More Doth Beauty Beauteous Seem ,O| how much more doth beauty beauteous seem|By that sweet ornament which truth doth give!|The rose looks fair| but fairer we it deem|For that sweet odour which doth in it live.|The canker blooms have full as deep a dye|As the perfumèd tincture of the roses||Hang on such thorns| and play as wantonly|When summer's breath their maskèd buds discloses;|But| for their virtue only is their show||They live unwooed and unrespected fade||Die to themselves.

An Hymn In Honour Of Beauty ,AH whither| Love| wilt thou now carry me?|What wontless fury dost thou now inspire|Into my feeble breast| too full of thee?|Whilst seeking to aslake thy raging fire||Thou in me kindlest much more great desire||And up aloft above my strength dost raise|The wondrous matter of my fire to praise.|That as I erst in praise of thine own name||So now in honour of thy mother dear||An honourable hymn I eke should frame||And with the brightness of her beauty clear||The ravish'd hearts of gazeful men might rear|To admiration of that heavenly light||From whence proceeds such soul-enchanting might.|Thereto do thou| great goddess| queen of beauty||Mother of love| and of all world's delight||Without whose sovereign grace and kindly duty|Nothing on earth seems fair to fleshly sight||Do thou vouchsafe with thy love-kindling light|T' illuminate my dim and dulled eyne||And beautify this sacred hymn of thine:|That both to thee| to whom I mean it most||And eke to her| whose fair immortal beam|Hath darted fire into my feeble ghost||That now it wasted is with woes extreme||It may so please| that she at length will stream|Some dew of grace into my withered heart||After long sorrow and consuming smart.|WHAT time this world's great Workmaster did cast|To make all things such as we now behold||It seems that he before his eyes had plac'd|A goodly pattern| to whose perfect mould|He fashion'd them as comely as he could;|That now so fair and seemly they appear||As nought may be amended anywhere.|That wondrous pattern| wheresoe'er it be||Whether in earth laid up in secret store||Or else in heaven| that no man may it see|With sinful eyes| for fear it to deflore||Is perfect Beauty| which all men adore;|Whose face and feature doth so much excel|All mortal sense| that none the same may tell.|Thereof as every earthly thing partakes|Or more or less| by influence divine||So it more fair accordingly it makes||And the gross matter of this earthly mine||Which clotheth it| thereafter doth refine||Doing away the dross which dims the light|Of that fair beam which therein is empight.|For| through infusion of celestial power||The duller earth it quick'neth with delight||And lifeful spirits privily doth pour|Through all the parts| that to the looker's sight|They seem to please. That is thy sovereign might||O Cyprian queen| which flowing from the beam|Of thy bright star| thou into them dost stream.|That is the thing which giveth pleasant grace|To all things fair| that kindleth lively fire||Light of thy lamp| which| shining in the face||Thence to the soul darts amorous desire||And robs the hearts of those which it admire;|Therewith thou pointest thy son's poison'd arrow||That wounds the life| and wastes the inmost marrow.|How vainly then do idle wits invent||That beauty is nought else but mixture made|Of colours fair| and goodly temp'rament|Of pure complexions| that shall quickly fade|And pass away| like to a summer's shade;|Or that it is but comely composition|Of parts well measur'd| with meet disposition.|Hath white and red in it such wondrous power||That it can pierce through th' eyes unto the heart||And therein stir such rage and restless stour||As nought but death can stint his dolour's smart?|Or can proportion of the outward part|Move such affection in the inward mind||That it can rob both sense and reason blind?|Why do not then the blossoms of the field||Which are array'd with much more orient hue||And to the sense most dainty odours yield||Work like impression in the looker's view?|Or why do not fair pictures like power shew||In which oft-times we nature see of art|Excell'd| in perfect limning every part?|But ah| believe me| there is more than so||That works such wonders in the minds of men;|I| that have often prov'd| too well it know||And whoso list the like assays to ken||Shall find by trial| and confess it then||That beauty is not| as fond men misdeem||An outward shew of things| that only seem.|For that same goodly hue of white and red||With which the cheeks are sprinkled| shall decay||And those sweet rosy leaves| so fairly spread|Upon the lips| shall fade and fall away|To that they were| even to corrupted clay;|That golden wire| those sparkling stars so bright||Shall turn to dust; and lose their goodly light.|But that fair lamp| from whose celestial ray|That light proceeds| which kindleth lovers' fire||Shall never be extinguish'd nor decay;|But when the vital spirits do expire||Unto her native planet shall retire;|For it is heavenly born and cannot die||Being a parcel of the purest sky.|For when the soul| the which derived was||At first| out of that great immortal Spright||By whom all live to love| whilom did pass|Down from the top of purest heaven's height|To be embodied here| it then took light|And lively spirits from that fairest star||Which lights the world forth from his fiery car.|Which power retaining still or more or less||When she in fleshly seed is eft enraced||Through every part she doth the same impress||According as the heavens have her graced||And frames her house| in which she will be placed||Fit for herself| adorning it with spoil|Of th' heavenly riches which she robb'd erewhile.|Thereof it comes that these fair souls| which have|The most resemblance of that heavenly light||Frame to themselves most beautiful and brave|Their fleshly bower| most fit for their delight||And the gross matter by a sovereign might|Tempers so trim| that it may well be seen|A palace fit for such a virgin queen.|So every spirit| as it is most pure||And hath in it the more of heavenly light||So it the fairer body doth procure|To habit in| and it more fairly dight|With cheerful grace and amiable sight.|For of the soul the body form doth take:|For soul is form| and doth the body make.|Therefore wherever that thou dost behold|A comely corpse| with beauty fair endued||Know this for certain| that the same doth hold|A beauteous soul| with fair conditions thewed||Fit to receive the seed of virtue strewed.|For all that fair is| is by nature good;|That is a sign to know the gentle blood.|Yet oft it falls that many a gentle mind|Dwells in deformed tabernacle drown'd||Either by chance| against the course of kind||Or through unaptness in the substance found||Which it assumed of some stubborn ground||That will not yield unto her form's direction||But is deform'd with some foul imperfection.|And oft it falls| (ay me| the more to rue)|That goodly beauty| albe heavenly born||Is foul abus'd| and that celestial hue||Which doth the world with her delight adorn||Made but the bait of sin| and sinners' scorn||Whilst every one doth seek and sue to have it||But every one doth seek but to deprave it.|Yet nathëmore is that fair beauty's blame||But theirs that do abuse it unto ill:|Nothing so good| but that through guilty shame|May be corrupt| and wrested unto will:|Natheless the soul is fair and beauteous still||However flesh{"e}s fault it filthy make;|For things immortal no corruption take.|But ye fair dames| the world's dear ornaments|And lively images of heaven's light||Let not your beams with such disparagements|Be dimm'd| and your bright glory dark'ned quite;|But mindful still of your first country's sight||Do still preserve your first informed grace||Whose shadow yet shines in your beauteous face.|Loathe that foul blot| that hellish firebrand||Disloyal lust| fair beauty's foulest blame||That base affections| which your ears would bland||Commend to you by love's abused name||But is indeed the bondslave of defame;|Which will the garland of your glory mar||And quench the light of your bright shining star.|But gentle Love| that loyal is and true||Will more illumine your resplendent ray||And add more brightness to your goodly hue||From light of his pure fire; which| by like way|Kindled of yours| your likeness doth display;|Like as two mirrors| by oppos'd reflection||Do both express the face's first impression.|Therefore| to make your beauty more appear||It you behoves to love| and forth to lay|That heavenly riches which in you ye bear||That men the more admire their fountain may;|For else what booteth that celestial ray||If it in darkness be enshrined ever||That it of loving eyes be viewed never?|But| in your choice of loves| this well advise||That likest to yourselves ye them select||The which your forms' first source may sympathize||And with like beauty's parts be inly deckt;|For| if you loosely love without respect||It is no love| but a discordant war||Whose unlike parts amongst themselves do jar.|For love is a celestial harmony|Of likely hearts compos'd of stars' concent||Which join together in sweet sympathy||To work each other's joy and true content||Which they have harbour'd since their first descent|Out of their heavenly bowers| where they did see|And know each other here belov'd to be.|Then wrong it were that any other twain|Should in love's gentle band combined be|But those whom Heaven did at first ordain||And made out of one mould the more t' agree;|For all that like the beauty which they see||Straight do not love; for love is not so light|As straight to burn at first beholder's sight.|But they| which love indeed| look otherwise||With pure regard and spotless true intent||Drawing out of the object of their eyes|A more refined form| which they present|Unto their mind| void of all blemishment;|Which it reducing to her first perfection||Beholdeth free from flesh's frail infection.|And then conforming it unto the light||Which in itself it hath remaining still||Of that first Sun| yet sparkling in his sight||Thereof he fashions in his higher skill|An heavenly beauty to his fancy's will;|And it embracing in his mind entire||The mirror of his own thought doth admire.|Which seeing now so inly fair to be||As outward it appeareth to the eye||And with his spirit's proportion to agree||He thereon fixeth all his fantasy||And fully setteth his felicity;|Counting it fairer than it is indeed||And yet indeed her fairness doth exceed.|For lovers' eyes more sharply sighted be|Than other men's| and in dear love's delight|See more than any other eyes can see||Through mutual receipt of beam{"e}s bright||Which carry privy message to the spright||And to their eyes that inmost fair display||As plain as light discovers dawning day.|Therein they see| through amorous eye-glances||Armies of loves still flying to and fro||Which dart at them their little fiery lances;|Whom having wounded| back again they go||Carrying compassion to their lovely foe;|Who| seeing her fair eyes' so sharp effect||Cures all their sorrows with one sweet aspect.|In which how many wonders do they rede|To their conceit| that others never see||Now of her smiles| with which their souls they feed||Like gods with nectar in their banquets free;|Now of her looks| which like to cordials be;|But when her words' embássade forth she sends||Lord| how sweet music that unto them lends.|Sometimes upon her forehead they behold|A thousand graces masking in delight;|Sometimes within her eyelids they unfold|Ten thousand sweet belgards| which to their sight|Do seem like twinkling stars in frosty night;|But on her lips| like rosy buds in May||So many millions of chaste pleasures play.|All those| O Cytherea| and thousands more|Thy handmaids be| which do on thee attend||To deck thy beauty with their dainties' store||That may it more to mortal eyes commend||And make it more admir'd of foe and friend:|That in men's hearts thou may'st thy throne install||And spread thy lovely kingdom over all.|Then Iö| triumph! O great Beauty's Queen||Advance the banner of thy conquest high||That all this world| the which thy vassals bene||May draw to thee| and with due fealty|Adore the power of thy great majesty||Singing this hymn in honour of thy name||Compil'd by me| which thy poor liegeman am.|In lieu whereof grant| O great sovereign||That she whose conquering beauty doth captive|My trembling heart in her eternal chain||One drop of grace at length will to me give||That I her bounden thrall by her may live||And this same life| which first fro me she reaved||May owe to her| of whom I it received.|And you| fair Venus' darling| my dear dread||Fresh flower of grace| great goddess of my life||When your fair eyes these fearful lines shall read||Deign to let fall one drop of due relief||That may recure my heart's long pining grief||And shew what wondrous power your beauty hath||That can restore a damned wight from death.,Spenser Edmund,beauty
Beauty Imposes ,Beauty imposes reverence in the Spring||Grave as the urge within the honeybuds||It wounds us as we sing.|Beauty is joy that stays not overlong.|Clad in the magic of sincerities||It rides up in a song.|Beauty imposes chastenings on the heart||Grave as the birds in last solemnities|Assembling to depart.,Neilson Shaw,beauty

An Hymn Of Heavenly Beauty ,Rapt with the rage of mine own ravish'd thought||Through contemplation of those goodly sights||And glorious images in heaven wrought||Whose wondrous beauty| breathing sweet delights|Do kindle love in high-conceited sprights;|I fain to tell the things that I behold||But feel my wits to fail| and tongue to fold.|Vouchsafe then| O thou most Almighty Spright||From whom all gifts of wit and knowledge flow||To shed into my breast some sparkling light|Of thine eternal truth| that I may show|Some little beams to mortal eyes below|Of that immortal beauty| there with thee||Which in my weak distraughted mind I see;|That with the glory of so goodly sight|The hearts of men| which fondly here admire|Fair seeming shews| and feed on vain delight||Transported with celestial desire|Of those fair forms| may lift themselves up higher||And learn to love| with zealous humble duty||Th' eternal fountain of that heavenly beauty.|Beginning then below| with th' easy view|Of this base world| subject to fleshly eye||From thence to mount aloft| by order due||To contemplation of th' immortal sky;|Of the soare falcon so I learn to fly||That flags awhile her fluttering wings beneath||Till she herself for stronger flight can breathe.|Then look| who list thy gazeful eyes to feed|With sight of that is fair| look on the frame|Of this wide universe| and therein reed|The endless kinds of creatures which by name|Thou canst not count| much less their natures aim;|All which are made with wondrous wise respect||And all with admirable beauty deckt.|First th' earth| on adamantine pillars founded||Amid the sea engirt with brazen bands;|Then th' air still flitting| but yet firmly bounded|On every side| with piles of flaming brands||Never consum'd| nor quench'd with mortal hands;|And last| that mighty shining crystal wall||Wherewith he hath encompassed this All.|By view whereof it plainly may appear||That still as every thing doth upward tend||And further is from earth| so still more clear|And fair it grows| till to his perfect end|Of purest beauty it at last ascend;|Air more than water| fire much more than air||And heaven than fire| appears more pure and fair.|Look thou no further| but affix thine eye|On that bright| shiny| round| still moving mass||The house of blessed gods| which men call sky||All sow'd with glist'ring stars more thick than grass||Whereof each other doth in brightness pass||But those two most| which ruling night and day||As king and queen| the heavens' empire sway;|And tell me then| what hast thou ever seen|That to their beauty may compared be||Or can the sight that is most sharp and keen|Endure their captain's flaming head to see?|How much less those| much higher in degree||And so much fairer| and much more than these||As these are fairer than the land and seas?|For far above these heavens| which here we see||Be others far exceeding these in light||Not bounded| not corrupt| as these same be||But infinite in largeness and in height||Unmoving| uncorrupt| and spotless bright||That need no sun t' illuminate their spheres||But their own native light far passing theirs.|And as these heavens still by degrees arise||Until they come to their first Mover's bound||That in his mighty compass doth comprise||And carry all the rest with him around;|So those likewise do by degrees redound||And rise more fair; till they at last arrive|To the most fair| whereto they all do strive.|Fair is the heaven where happy souls have place||In full enjoyment of felicity||Whence they do still behold the glorious face|Of the divine eternal Majesty;|More fair is that| where those Ideas on high|Enranged be| which Plato so admired||And pure Intelligences from God inspired.|Yet fairer is that heaven| in which do reign|The sovereign Powers and mighty Potentates||Which in their high protections do contain|All mortal princes and imperial states;|And fairer yet| whereas the royal Seats|And heavenly Dominations are set||From whom all earthly governance is fet.|Yet far more fair be those bright Cherubins||Which all with golden wings are overdight||And those eternal burning Seraphins||Which from their faces dart out fiery light;|Yet fairer than they both| and much more bright||Be th' Angels and Archangels| which attend|On God's own person| without rest or end.|These thus in fair each other far excelling||As to the highest they approach more near||Yet is that highest far beyond all telling||Fairer than all the rest which there appear||Though all their beauties join'd together were;|How then can mortal tongue hope to express|The image of such endless perfectness?|Cease then| my tongue| and lend unto my mind|Leave to bethink how great that beauty is||Whose utmost parts so beautiful I find;|How much more those essential parts of his||His truth| his love| his wisdom| and his bliss||His grace| his doom| his mercy| and his might||By which he lends us of himself a sight.|Those unto all he daily doth display||And shew himself in th' image of his grace||As in a looking-glass| through which he may|Be seen of all his creatures vile and base||That are unable else to see his face||His glorious face which glistereth else so bright||That th' Angels selves cannot endure his sight.|But we| frail wights| whose sight cannot sustain|The sun's bright beams when he on us doth shine||But that their points rebutted back again|Are dull'd| how can we see with feeble eyne|The glory of that Majesty Divine||In sight of whom both sun and moon are dark||Compared to his least resplendent spark?|The means| therefore| which unto us is lent|Him to behold| is on his works to look||Which he hath made in beauty excellent||And in the same| as in a brazen book||To read enregister'd in every nook|His goodness| which his beauty doth declare;|For all that's good is beautiful and fair.|Thence gathering plumes of perfect speculation||To imp the wings of thy high-flying mind||Mount up aloft through heavenly contemplation||From this dark world| whose damps the soul so blind||And| like the native brood of eagles' kind||On that bright Sun of Glory fix thine eyes||Clear'd from gross mists of frail infirmities.|Humbled with fear and awful reverence||Before the footstool of his majesty|Throw thyself down| with trembling innocence||Ne dare look up with corruptible eye|On the dread face of that great Deity||For fear| lest if he chance to look on thee||Thou turn to nought| and quite confounded be.|But lowly fall before his mercy seat||Close covered with the Lamb's integrity|From the just wrath of his avengeful threat|That sits upon the righteous throne on high;|His throne is built upon eternity||More firm and durable than steel or brass||Or the hard diamond| which them both doth pass.|His sceptre is the rod of righteousness||With which he bruiseth all his foes to dust||And the great Dragon strongly doth repress||Under the rigour of his judgement just;|His seat is truth| to which the faithful trust||From whence proceed her beams so pure and bright|That all about him sheddeth glorious light:|Light far exceeding that bright blazing spark|Which darted is from Titan's flaming head||That with his beams enlumineth the dark|And dampish air| whereby all things are read;|Whose nature yet so much is marvelled|Of mortal wits| that it doth much amaze|The greatest wizards which thereon do gaze.|But that immortal light| which there doth shine||Is many thousand times more bright| more clear||More excellent| more glorious| more divine||Through which to God all mortal actions here||And even the thoughts of men| do plain appear;|For from th' eternal truth it doth proceed||Through heavenly virtue which her beams do breed.|With the great glory of that wondrous light|His throne is all encompassed around||And hid in his own brightness from the sight|Of all that look thereon with eyes unsound;|And underneath his feet are to be found|Thunder and lightning and tempestuous fire||The instruments of his avenging ire.|There in his bosom Sapience doth sit||The sovereign darling of the Deity||Clad like a queen in royal robes| most fit|For so great power and peerless majesty||And all with gems and jewels gorgeously|Adorn'd| that brighter than the stars appear||And make her native brightness seem more clear.|And on her head a crown of purest gold|Is set| in sign of highest sovereignty;|And in her hand a sceptre she doth hold||With which she rules the house of God on high||And manageth the ever-moving sky||And in the same these lower creatures all|Subjected to her power imperial.|Both heaven and earth obey unto her will||And all the creatures which they both contain;|For of her fullness which the world doth fill|They all partake| and do in state remain|As their great Maker did at first ordain||Through observation of her high behest||By which they first were made| and still increast.|The fairness of her face no tongue can tell;|For she the daughters of all women's race||And angels eke| in beauty doth excel||Sparkled on her from God's own glorious face||And more increas'd by her own goodly grace||That it doth far exceed all human thought||Ne can on earth compared be to aught.|Ne could that painter (had he lived yet)|Which pictured Venus with so curious quill||That all posterity admired it||Have portray'd this| for all his mast'ring skill;|Ne she herself| had she remained still||And were as fair as fabling wits do feign||Could once come near this beauty sovereign.|But had those wits| the wonders of their days||Or that sweet Teian poet| which did spend|His plenteous vein in setting forth her praise||Seen but a glimpse of this which I pretend||How wondrously would he her face commend||Above that idol of his feigning thought||That all the world should with his rhymes be fraught.|How then dare I| the novice of his art||Presume to picture so divine a wight||Or hope t' express her least perfection's part||Whose beauty fills the heavens with her light||And darks the earth with shadow of her sight?|Ah| gentle Muse| thou art too weak and faint|The portrait of so heavenly hue to paint.|Let angels| which her goodly face behold|And see at will| her sovereign praises sing||And those most sacred mysteries unfold|Of that fair love of mighty heaven's King;|Enough is me t' admire so heavenly thing||And being thus with her huge love possest||In th' only wonder of herself to rest.|But whoso may| thrice happy man him hold||Of all on earth whom God so much doth grace|And lets his own beloved to behold;|For in the view of her celestial face|All joy| all bliss| all happiness| have place;|Ne aught on earth can want unto the wight|Who of herself can win the wishful sight.|For she| out of her secret treasury||Plenty of riches forth on him will pour||Even heavenly riches| which there hidden lie|Within the closet of her chastest bower||Th' eternal portion of her precious dower||Which mighty God hath given to her free||And to all those which thereof worthy be.|None thereof worthy be| but those whom she|Vouchsafeth to her presence to receive||And letteth them her lovely face to see||Whereof such wondrous pleasures they conceive||And sweet contentment| that it doth bereave|Their soul of sense| through infinite delight||And them transport from flesh into the spright.|In which they see such admirable things||As carries them into an ecstasy||And hear such heavenly notes| and carollings|Of God's high praise| that fills the brazen sky;|And feel such joy and pleasure inwardly||That maketh them all worldly cares forget||And only think on that before them set.|Ne from thenceforth doth any fleshly sense||Or idle thought of earthly things| remain;|But all that erst seem'd sweet seems now offence||And all that pleased erst now seems to pain;|Their joy| their comfort| their desire| their gain||Is fixed all on that which now they see;|All other sights but feigned shadows be.|And that fair lamp| which useth to inflame|The hearts of men with self-consuming fire|Thenceforth seems foul| and full of sinful blame;|And all that pomp to which proud minds aspire|By name of honour| and so much desire||Seems to them baseness| and all riches dross||And all mirth sadness| and all lucre loss.|So full their eyes are of that glorious sight||And senses fraught with such satiety||That in nought else on earth they can delight||But in th' aspect of that felicity||Which they have written in their inward eye;|On which they feed| and in their fastened mind|All happy joy and full contentment find.|Ah| then| my hungry soul| which long hast fed|On idle fancies of thy foolish thought||And| with false beauty's flatt'ring bait misled||Hast after vain deceitful shadows sought||Which all are fled| and now have left thee nought|But late repentance through thy follies prief;|Ah cease to gaze on matter of thy grief:|And look at last up to that sovereign light||From whose pure beams all perfect beauty springs||That kindleth love in every godly sprite||Even the love of God| which loathing brings|Of this vile world and these gay-seeming things;|With whose sweet pleasures being so possest||Thy straying thoughts henceforth for ever rest.,Spenser Edmund,beauty
The Living Beauty ,I BADE| because the wick and oil are spent|And frozen are the channels of the blood||My discontented heart to draw content|From beauty that is cast out of a mould|In bronze| or that in dazzling marble appears||Appears| but when wc have gone is gone again||Being more indifferent to our solitude|Than 'twere an apparition.

Sonnet Iv: Bright Star Of Beauty ,Bright star of beauty| on whose eyelids sit|A thousand nymph-like and enamour'd Graces||The Goddesses of Memory and Wit||Which there in order take their several places;|In whose dear bosom sweet delicious Love|Lays down his quiver| which he once did bear||Since he that blessed Paradise did prove||And leaves his mother's lap to sport him there.|Let others strive to entertain with words;|My soul is of a braver metal made;|I hold that vile which vulgar wit affords;|In me's that faith which Time cannot invade.|Let what I praise be still made good by you;|Be you most worthy| whilst I am most true.,Drayton Michael,beauty
The Song Of Princess Zeb,WHEN from my cheek I lift my veil||The roses turn with envy pale||And from their pierced hearts| rich with pain||Send forth their fragrance like a wail.|Or if perchance one perfumed tress|Be lowered to the wind's caress||The honeyed hyacinths complain||And languish in a sweet distress.|And| when I pause| still groves among||(Such loveliness is mine) a throng|Of nightingales awake and strain|Their souls into a quivering song.,Naidu Sarojini,beauty

A Sonnet To Heavenly Beauty ,If this our little life is but a day|In the Eternal| - if the years in vain|Toil after hours that never come again| -|If everything that hath been must decay||Why dreamest thou of joys that pass away||My soul| that my sad body doth restrain?|Why of the moment’s pleasure art thou fain?|Nay| thou hast wings| - nay| seek another stay.|There is the joy whereto each soul aspires||And there the rest that all the world desires||And there is love| and peace| and gracious mirth;|And there in the most highest heavens shalt thou|Behold the Very Beauty| whereof now|Thou worshippest the shadow upon earth.,Bellay du,beauty
Bad Day At The Beauty Salon ,I was a 20 year old unemployed receptionist with dyed orange dreadlocks sprouting out of my skull. I needed a job| but first| I needed a haircut.|So I head for this beauty salon on Avenue B.|I'm gonna get a hairdo.|I'm gonna look just like those hot Spanish haircut models| become brown and bodacious| grow some 7 inch fingernails painted bitch red and rake them down the chalkboard of the job market's soul.|So I go in the beauty salon.|This beautiful Puerto Rican girl in tight white spandex and a push-up bra sits me down and starts chopping my hair:|"Girlfriend|" she says| "what the hell you got growing outta your head there| what is that| hair implants? Yuck| you want me to touch that shit| whadya got in there| sandwiches?"|I just go: "I'm sorry."|She starts snipping my carefully cultivated Johnny Lydon post-Pistols hairdo. My foul little dreadlocks are flying around all over the place but I'm not looking in the mirror cause I just don't want to know.|"So what's your name anyway?" My stylist demands then.|"Uh| Maggie."|"Maggie? Well| that's an okay name| but my name is Suzy."|"Yeah| so?"|"Yeah so it ain't just Suzy S.U.Z.Y| I spell it S.U.Z.E.E| the extra "e" is for extra Suzee."|I nod emphatically.|Suzee tells me when she's not busy chopping hair| she works as an exotic dancer at night to support her boyfriend named Rocco. Suzee loves Rocco| she loves him so much she's got her eyes closed as she describes him:|"6 foot 2| 193 pounds and| girlfriend| his arms so big and long they wrap around me twice like I'm a little Suzee sandwich."|Little Suzee Sandwich is rapt| she blindly snips and clips at my poor punk head. She snips and clips and snips and clips| she pauses| I look in the mirror: "Holy shit| I'm bald."|"Holy shit| baby| you're bald." Suzee says| finally opening her eyes and then gasping.|All I've got left is little post-nuke clumps of orange fuzz. And I'll never get a receptionist job now.|But Suzy waves her manicured finger in my face: "Don't you worry| baby| I'm gonna get you a job at the dancing club."|"What?"|" ;Baby| let me tell you| the boys are gonna like a bald go go dancer."|That said| she whips out some clippers| shaves my head smooth and insists I'm gonna love getting naked for a living.|None of this sounds like my idea of a good time| but I'm broke and I'm bald so I go home and get my best panties. Suzee lends me some 6 inch pumps| paints my lips bright red| and gives me 7 shots of Jack Daniels to relax me.|8pm that night I take the stage.|I'm bald||I'm drunk||and by god||I'm naked.|HOLY SHIT I'M NAKED IN A ROOM FULL OF STRANGERS THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE RECURRING NIGHTMARES WE ALL HAVE ABOUT BEING BUTT NAKED IN PUBLIC| I AM NAKED| I DON'T KNOW THESE PEOPLE| THIS REALLY SUCKS.|A few guys feel sorry for me and risk getting their hands bitten off by sticking dollars in my garter belt. My disheveled pubic hairs stand at full attention| ready to poke the guys' eyes out if they get too close.|Then I notice this bald guy in the audience| I've got a new empathy for bald people| I figure maybe it works both ways| maybe this guy will stick 10 bucks in my garter.|I saunter over.|I'm teetering around unrhythmically| I'm the surliest| unsexiest dancer that ever go-go across this hemisphere. The bald guy looks down into his beer| he'd much rather look at that than at my pubic mound which has now formed into one vicious spike so it looks like I've got a unicorn in my crotch.|I stand there weaving through the air.|The strobe light is illuminating my pubic unicorn. Madonna's song Borderline is pumping through the club's speaker system for the 5th time tonight: "BORDERLINE BORDERLINE BORDERLINE/LOVE ME TIL I JUST CAN'T SEE." And suddenly| I start to wonder: What does that mean anyway?|"LOVE ME TIL I JUST CAN'T SEE"|What?|Screw me so much my eyes pop out| I go blind| end up walking down 2nd Avenue crazy| horny| naked and blind? What?|There's a glitch in the tape and it starts to skip.|"Borderl...ooop.....Borderl.... ooop...Borderlin.....ooop"|I stumble and twist my ankle. My g-string rides between my buttcheeks making me twitch with pain. My head starts spinning| my knees wobble| I go down on all fours and puke all over the bald guy's lap.|So there I am. Butt naked on all fours. But before I have time to regain my composure| the strip club manager comes over| points his smarmy strip club manager finger at me and goes:|"You're bald| you're drunk| you can't dance and you're fired."|I stand up.|"Oh yeah| well you stink like a sneaker| pal." I peel off one of my pumps and throw it in the direction of his fat head then I get the hell out of there.|A few days later I run into Suzee on Avenue A. Turns out she got fired for getting me a job there in the first place. But she was completely undaunted| she dragged me up to this wig store on 14th Street| bought me a mouse brown shag wig| then got us both telemarketing jobs on Wall Street.|And I never went to a beauty salon again.,Estep Maggie,beauty
A Philosophy Of Beauty ,These evil days require you to grit your teeth in misery to survive||But you have to realize life is more|Than staying alive:|You have to create magical kindness in the heart||Follow the skyscraper skyline|While in ecstasy pursuing art;|But still| I grow weary of cops kicking the homeless|Down heartless streets||I’ll have to go out west and live in the sand||Dance at dusk upon the beach||Later| on midnight dunes I’ll sleep.|Living out your Divinity involves a philosophy of beauty|And refusing to hurt anyone.,Hamilton Uriah,beauty

A Thing Of Beauty (Endymion) ,A thing of beauty is a joy for ever:|Its lovliness increases; it will never|Pass into nothingness; but still will keep|A bower quiet for us| and a sleep|Full of sweet dreams| and health| and quiet breathing.|Therefore| on every morrow| are we wreathing|A flowery band to bind us to the earth||Spite of despondence| of the inhuman dearth|Of noble natures| of the gloomy days||Of all the unhealthy and o'er-darkn'd ways|Made for our searching: yes| in spite of all||Some shape of beauty moves away the pall|From our dark spirits. Such the sun| the moon||Trees old and young| sprouting a shady boon|For simple sheep; and such are daffodils|With the green world they live in; and clear rills|That for themselves a cooling covert make|'Gainst the hot season; the mid-forest brake||Rich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms:|And such too is the grandeur of the dooms|We have imagined for the mighty dead;|An endless fountain of immortal drink||Pouring unto us from the heaven's brink.,Keats John,beauty
Rondel Of Merciless Beauty ,Your two great eyes will slay me suddenly;|Their beauty shakes me who was once serene;|Straight through my heart the wound is quick and keen.|Only your word will heal the injury|To my hurt heart| while yet the wound is clean -|Your two great eyes will slay me suddenly;|Their beauty shakes me who was once serene.|Upon my word| I tell you faithfully|Through life and after death you are my queen;|For with my death the whole truth shall be seen.|Your two great eyes will slay me suddenly;|Their beauty shakes me who was once serene;|Straight through my heart the wound is quick and keen.,Chaucer Geoffrey,beauty
I Died For Beauty ,I died for beauty| but was scarce|Adjusted in the tomb||When one who died for truth was lain|In an adjoining room.|He questioned softly why I failed?|"For beauty|" I replied.|"And I for truth - the two are one;|We brethren are|" he said.|And so| as kinsmen met a-night||We talked between the rooms||Until the moss had reached our lips||And covered up our names.,Dickinson Emily,beauty
Beauty ,The beautiful| the fair| the elegant||Is that which pleases us| says Kant||Without a thought of interest or advantage.|I used to watch men when they spoke of beauty|And measure their enthusiasm. One|An old man| seeing a ()  setting sun||Praised it ()  a certain sense of duty|To the calm evening and his time of life.|I know another man that never says a Beauty|But of a horse; ()|Men seldom speak of beauty| beauty as such||Not even lovers think about it much.|Women of course consider it for hours|In mirrors; ()|A shrapnel ball -|Just where the wet skin glistened when he swam -|Like a fully-opened sea-anemone.|We both said 'What a beauty! What a beauty| lad'|I knew that in that flower he saw a hope|Of living on| and seeing again the roses of his home.|Beauty is that which pleases and delights||Not bringing personal advantage - Kant.|But later on I heard|A canker worked into that crimson flower|And that he sank with it|And laid it with the anemones off Dover.,Owen Wilfred,beauty

The Unfading Beauty ,HE that loves a rosy cheek||Or a coral lip admires||Or from star-like eyes doth seek|Fuel to maintain his fires:|As old Time makes these decay||So his flames must waste away.|But a smooth and steadfast mind||Gentle thoughts and calm desires||Hearts with equal love combined||Kindle never-dying fires.|Where these are not| I despise|Lovely cheeks or lips or eyes.,Carew Thomas,beauty
Behold| I Adore Beauty ,Beauty is warm and cold|Beauty is black and bold|Beauty is different for us all I am told|Beauty I would love a chance to mould|Beauty gives the finest pleasure I am told|Beauty can be bought and sold|To the one and only highest bidder|While it graciously glitters like gold|I adore beauty|Oh! How I adore beauty with a passion|I adore beauty with every last breath|Beauty itself is not exempt|From the laws of birth and death|It experiences the joys of being young and old|Blossoming each day in early youth|Maturing adoringly each day with age|Behold| I adore beauty|Oh! How I adore beauty with a passion|Beauty is something I would like to hold|Where there is too much ugly|I can bring it out of a drawer and unfold|Spread it around the entire household|Without worrying about getting a scold|Behold| I adore beauty|Oh! How I adore beauty|When out on a nightie|Quite hungry and thirsty|And you drink the last drops of milk|From a beautiful chest that is busty|I would say| that itself is a faculty of beauty|Copyright 2006 - Sylvia Chidi,Chidi Sylvia,beauty

Sonnet L: Beauty| Sweet Love ,Beauty| sweet love| is like the morning dew|Whose short refresh upon the tender green|Cheers for a time but till the Sun doth show||And straight 'tis gone as it had never been.|Soon doth it fade that makes the fairest flourish;|Short is the glory of the blushing Rose||The hue which thou so carefully dost nourish|Yet which at length thou must be forc'd to lose.|When thou surcharg'd with burden of thy years|Shalt bend thy wrinkles homeward to the earth||When Time hath made a passport for thy fears||Dated in age the Kalends of our death--|But| ah| no more: this hath been often told||And women grieve to think they must be old.,Daniel Samuel,beauty

It Is Not Beauty I Demand ,It is not Beauty I demand||A crystal brow| the moon's despair||Nor the snow's daughter| a white hand||Nor mermaid's yellow pride of hair.|Tell me not of your starry eyes||Your lips that seem on roses fed||Your breasts where Cupid trembling lies||Nor sleeps for kissing of his bed.|A bloomy pair of vermeil cheeks||Like Hebe's in her ruddiest hours||A breath that softer music speaks|Than summer winds a-wooing flowers.|These are but gauds; nay| what are lips?|Coral beneath the ocean-stream||Whose brink when your adventurer sips|Full oft he perisheth on them.|And what are cheeks but ensigns oft|That wave hot youth to fields of blood?|Did Helen's breast though ne'er so soft||Do Greece or Ilium any good?|Eyes can with baleful ardor burn||Poison can breath that erst perfumed||There's many a white hand holds an urn|With lovers' hearts to dust consumed.|For crystal brows--there's naught within||They are but empty cells for pride;|He who the Syren's hair would win|Is mostly strangled in the tide.|Give me| instead of beauty's bust||A tender heart| a loyal mind||Which with temptation I could trust||Yet never linked with error find.|One in whose gentle bosom I|Could pour my secret heart of woes.|Like the care-burdened honey-fly|That hides his murmurs in the rose.|My earthly comforter! whose love|So indefeasible might be||That when my spirit won above|Hers could not stay for sympathy.,Darley George,beauty
Beauty Queen Or Garden Gnome? ,You say that you can picture me sitting in my chair.|What is it that you picture when you look from over there?|Do you envision beauty or an ugly| wrinkled hag?|Does my skin give off a glow or do my wrinkles sag?|It's strange to think you picture someone you've never seen.|I could be short and squatty or maybe tall and lean.|What is the face that's given to represent this poem?|Is it of a beauty queen or just a garden gnome?,Nagy Mary,beauty

From 'The Testament Of Beauty' ,'Twas at that hour of beauty when the setting sun|squandereth his cloudy bed with rosy hues| to flood|his lov'd works as in turn he biddeth them Good-night;|and all the towers and temples and mansions of men|face him in bright farewell| ere they creep from their pomp|naked beneath the darkness;- while to mortal eyes|'tis given| ifso they close not of fatigue| nor strain|at lamplit tasks-'tis given| as for a royal boon|to beggarly outcasts in homeless vigil| to watch|where uncurtain's behind the great windows of space|Heav'n's jewel'd company circleth unapproachably-|'Twas at sunset that I| fleeing to hide my soul|in refuge of beauty from a mortal distress||walk'd alone with the Muse in her garden of thought||discoursing at liberty with the mazy dreams|that came wavering pertinaciously about me; as when|the small bats| issued from their hangings| flitter o'erhead|thru' the summer twilight| with thin cries to and fro|hunting in muffled flight atween the stars and flowers.|Then fell I in strange delusion| illusion strange to tell;|for as a man who lyeth fast asleep in his bed|may dream he waketh| and that he walketh upright|pursuing some endeavour in full conscience-so 'twas|with me; but contrawise; for being in truth awake|methought I slept and dreamt; and in thatt dream methought|I was telling a dream; nor telling was I as one|who| truly awaked from a true sleep| thinketh to tell|his dream to a friend| but for his scant remembrances|findeth no token of speech-it was not so with me;|for my tale was my dream and my dream the telling||and I remember wondring the while I told it|how I told it so tellingly.

An Elegy| To An Old Beauty ,In vain| poor Nymph| to please our youthful sight|You sleep in cream and frontlets all the night||Your face with patches soil| with paint repair||Dress with gay gowns| and shade with foreign hair.|If truth in spight of manners must be told||Why| really fifty-five is something old.|Once you were young; or one| whose life's so long|She might have born my mother| tells me wrong.|And once (since Envy's dead before you die|)|The women own| you play'd a sparkling eye||Taught the light foot a modish little trip||And pouted with the prettiest purple lip --|To some new charmer are the roses fled||Which blew| to damask all thy cheek with red;|Youth calls the Graces there to fix their reign||And airs by thousands fill their easy train.|So parting Summer bids her flow'ry prime|Attend the sun to dress some foreign clime||While with'ring seasons in succession| here||Strip the gay gardens| and deform the year.|But thou (since Nature bids) the world resign||'Tis now thy daughter's daughter's time to shine.|With more address| (or such as pleases more)|She runs her female exercises o'er||Unfurls or closes| raps or turns the Fan||And smiles| or blushes at the creature Man.|With quicker life| as guilded coaches pass||In sideling courtesy she drops the glass.|With better strength| on visit-days she bears|To mount her fifty flights of ample stairs.|Her mein| her shape| her temper| eyes and tongue|Are sure to conquer. -- for the rogue is young;|And all that's madly wild| or oddly gay||We call it only pretty Fanny's way.|Let time that makes you homely| make you sage||The sphere of wisdom is the sphere of age.|'Tis true| when beauty dawns with early fire||And hears the flatt'ring tongues of soft desire||If not from virtue| from its gravest ways|The soul with pleasing avocation strays.|But beauty gone| 'tis easier to be wise;|As harper better| by the loss of eyes.|Henceforth retire| reduce your roving airs||Haunt less the plays| and more the publick pray'rs||Reject the Mechlin Head| and gold brocade||Go pray| in sober Norwich Crape array'd.|Thy pendent diamonds let thy Fanny take||(Their trembling lustre shows how much you shake;)|Or bid her wear thy necklace row'd with pearl||You'll find your Fanny an obedient girl.|So for the rest| with less incumbrance hung||You walk thro' life| unmingled with the young;|And view the shade and substance as you pass|With joint endeavour trifling at the glass||Or Folly drest| and rambling all her days||To meet her counterpart| and grow by praise:|Yet still sedate your self| and gravely plain||You neither fret| nor envy at the vain.|'Twas thus (if Man with Woman we compare)|The wise Athenian crost a glittering fair||Unmov'd by tongues and sights| he walk'd the place||Thro' tape| toys| tinsel| gimp| perfume| and lace;|Then bends from Mars's Hill his awful eyes||And "What a world I never want?" he cries;|But cries unheard: For Folly will be free.|So parts the buzzing gaudy crowd| and he:|As careless he for them| as they for him;|He wrapt in wisdom| and they whirl'd by whim.,Parnell Thomas,beauty

Shallow Beauty ,It's unlikely but true -|Your physical attraction|Entertains me|On so many levels.|Your voice as smooth as slate|But subtle - soft and subtle -|And untarnished by locality|Draws my soul.|You utter practical nothings|Statistical representations|Cardboard cut-out numbers|Meaningless drivel;|I want to hear you speak|Of more important things -|Of life and loves and instincts|But am denied.|©2005 Jon Lloyd,Lloyd Jon,beauty
Racked Beauty ,Blest be the dawn| the luminous blue-slate||the arch transfused by the glorious sun||and blackbirds chanting hymnals in prickly bushes||and rooks high over fields coughing up love.|Blest be the winds about the furrowed brow||and the joyful whispers of dying leaves||the maples staggered blissfully behind barbed fences|above the tombs of the newly redeemed.|Blest be pain that comes like a stark beggar||the thorn-tree that has its roots in a star||the sweet massacred gourds tethered to the rusting gate||the apples heaped on the agonized floor.,Yankevich Leo,beauty
Winter Beauty ,The bleak of winter leaves me among despair|Thier is only anger and chill in the air|No happiness or laughing|Just grey clouds and bleak white sky|Dont let it all take hold of you for it has a strange beauty within.|A cold beauty|Like a beautiful woman with an empty soul.|In the winter I walk the slushy streets alone|I see the children play|Making angels and happy as if it were May|They seem to love the cold|But oh how this changes when you get old|Winter is still beautiful|In that strange cold way|Everytime it comes around thou|I feel I'm going to fade,Weaver Rachel,beauty

Beauty Clear And Fair ,BEAUTY clear and fair||Where the air|Rather like a perfume dwells;|Where the violet and the rose|Their blue veins and blush disclose||And come to honour nothing else:|Where to live near|And planted there|Is to live| and still live new;|Where to gain a favour is|More than light| perpetual bliss--|Make me live by serving you!|Dear| again back recall|To this light||A stranger to himself and all!|Both the wonder and the story|Shall be yours| and eke the glory;|I am your servant| and your thrall.,Fletcher John,beauty
Song. Murdering Beauty ,I'LL gaze no more on her bewitching face||Since ruin harbours there in every place ;|For my enchanted soul alike she drowns|With calms and tempests of her smiles and frowns.|I’ll love no more those cruel eyes of hers||Which| pleased or anger’d| still are murderers :|For if she dart| like lightning| through the air|Her beams of wrath| she kills me with despair :|If she behold me with a pleasing eye||I surfeit with excess of joy| and die.,Carew Thomas,beauty

Juvenilia| An Ode To Natural Beauty ,There is a power whose inspiration fills|Nature's fair fabric| sun- and star-inwrought||Like airy dew ere any drop distils||Like perfume in the laden flower| like aught|Unseen which interfused throughout the whole|Becomes its quickening pulse and principle and soul.|Now when| the drift of old desire renewing||Warm tides flow northward over valley and field||When half-forgotten sound and scent are wooing|From their deep-chambered recesses long sealed|Such memories as breathe once more|Of childhood and the happy hues it wore||Now| with a fervor that has never been|In years gone by| it stirs me to respond| --|Not as a force whose fountains are within|The faculties of the percipient mind||Subject with them to darkness and decay||But something absolute| something beyond||Oft met like tender orbs that seem to peer|From pale horizons| luminous behind|Some fringe of tinted cloud at close of day;|And in this flood of the reviving year||When to the loiterer by sylvan streams||Deep in those cares that make Youth loveliest||Nature in every common aspect seems|To comment on the burden in his breast --|The joys he covets and the dreams he dreams --|One then with all beneath the radiant skies|That laughs with him or sighs||It courses through the lilac-scented air||A blessing on the fields| a wonder everywhere.|Spirit of Beauty| whose sweet impulses||Flung like the rose of dawn across the sea||Alone can flush the exalted consciousness|With shafts of sensible divinity --|Light of the World| essential loveliness:|Him whom the Muse hath made thy votary|Not from her paths and gentle precepture|Shall vulgar ends engage| nor break the spell|That taught him first to feel thy secret charms|And o'er the earth| obedient to their lure||Their sweet surprise and endless miracle||To follow ever with insatiate arms.|On summer afternoons||When from the blue horizon to the shore||Casting faint silver pathways like the moon's|Across the Ocean's glassy| mottled floor||Far clouds uprear their gleaming battlements|Drawn to the crest of some bleak eminence||When autumn twilight fades on the sere hill|And autumn winds are still;|To watch the East for some emerging sign||Wintry Capella or the Pleiades|Or that great huntsman with the golden gear;|Ravished in hours like these|Before thy universal shrine|To feel the invoked presence hovering near||He stands enthusiastic. Star-lit hours|Spent on the roads of wandering solitude|Have set their sober impress on his brow||And he| with harmonies of wind and wood|And torrent and the tread of mountain showers||Has mingled many a dedicative vow|That holds him| till thy last delight be known||Bound in thy service and in thine alone.|I| too| among the visionary throng|Who choose to follow where thy pathway leads||Have sold my patrimony for a song||And donned the simple| lowly pilgrim's weeds.|From that first image of beloved walls||Deep-bowered in umbrage of ancestral trees||Where earliest thy sweet enchantment falls||Tingeing a child's fantastic reveries|With radiance so fair it seems to be|Of heavens just lost the lingering evidence|From that first dawn of roseate infancy||So long beneath thy tender influence|My breast has thrilled. As oft for one brief second|The veil through which those infinite offers beckoned|Has seemed to tremble| letting through|Some swift intolerable view|Of vistas past the sense of mortal seeing||So oft| as one whose stricken eyes might see|In ferny dells the rustic deity||I stood| like him| possessed| and all my being||Flooded an instant with unwonted light||Quivered with cosmic passion; whether then|On woody pass or glistening mountain-height|I walked in fellowship with winds and clouds||Whether in cities and the throngs of men||A curious saunterer through friendly crowds||Enamored of the glance in passing eyes||Unuttered salutations| mute replies| --|In every character where light of thine|Has shed on earthly things the hue of things divine|I sought eternal Loveliness| and seeking||If ever transport crossed my brow bespeaking|Such fire as a prophetic heart might feel|Where simple worship blends in fervent zeal||It was the faith that only love of thee|Needed in human hearts for Earth to see|Surpassed the vision poets have held dear|Of joy diffused in most communion here;|That whomsoe'er thy visitations warmed||Lover of thee in all thy rays informed||Needed no difficulter discipline|To seek his right to happiness within|Than| sensible of Nature's loveliness||To yield him to the generous impulses|By such a sentiment evoked. The thought||Bright Spirit| whose illuminings I sought||That thou unto thy worshipper might be|An all-sufficient law| abode with me||Importing something more than unsubstantial dreams|To vigils by lone shores and walks by murmuring streams.|Youth's flowers like childhood's fade and are forgot.|Fame twines a tardy crown of yellowing leaves.|How swift were disillusion| were it not|That thou art steadfast where all else deceives!|Solace and Inspiration| Power divine|That by some mystic sympathy of thine||When least it waits and most hath need of thee||Can startle the dull spirit suddenly|With grandeur welled from unsuspected springs| --|Long as the light of fulgent evenings||When from warm showers the pearly shades disband|And sunset opens o'er the humid land||Shows thy veiled immanence in orient skies| --|Long as pale mist and opalescent dyes|Hung on far isle or vanishing mountain-crest||Fields of remote enchantment can suggest|So sweet to wander in it matters nought||They hold no place but in impassioned thought||Long as one draught from a clear sky may be|A scented luxury;|Be thou my worship| thou my sole desire||Thy paths my pilgrimage| my sense a lyre|Aeolian for thine every breath to stir;|Oft when her full-blown periods recur||To see the birth of day's transparent moon|Far from cramped walls may fading afternoon|Find me expectant on some rising lawn;|Often depressed in dewy grass at dawn||Me| from sweet slumber underneath green boughs||Ere the stars flee may forest matins rouse||Afoot when the great sun in amber floods|Pours horizontal through the steaming woods|And windless fumes from early chimneys start|And many a cock-crow cheers the traveller's heart|Eager for aught the coming day afford|In hills untopped and valleys unexplored.|Give me the white road into the world's ends||Lover of roadside hazard| roadside friends||Loiterer oft by upland farms to gaze|On ample prospects| lost in glimmering haze|At noon| or where down odorous dales twilit||Filled with low thundering of the mountain stream||Over the plain where blue seas border it|The torrid coast-towns gleam.|I have fared too far to turn back now; my breast|Burns with the lust for splendors unrevealed||Stars of midsummer| clouds out of the west||Pallid horizons| winds that valley and field|Laden with joy| be ye my refuge still!|What though distress and poverty assail!|Though other voices chide| yours never will.|The grace of a blue sky can never fail.|Powers that my childhood with a spell so sweet||My youth with visions of such glory nursed||Ye have beheld| nor ever seen my feet|On any venture set| but 'twas the thirst|For Beauty willed them| yea| whatever be|The faults I wanted wings to rise above;|I am cheered yet to think how steadfastly|I have been loyal to the love of Love!,Seeger Alan,beauty
Sonnet Xxi: If Beauty Thus Be Clouded ,If Beauty thus be clouded with a frown||That pity shines no comfort to my bliss||And vapors of disdain so overfrown||That my life's light thus wholy darken'd is||Why should I more molest the world with cries||The air with sighs| the earth below with tears?|Since I live hateful to those ruthless eyes||Vexing with untun'd moan her dainty ears;|If I have lov'd her dearer than my breath||My breath that calls the heav'ns to witness it||And still must hold her dear till after death;|And if that all this cannot move a whit||Yet let her say that she hath done me wrong||To use me thus and know I lov'd so long.,Daniel Samuel,beauty

Song Of Nature ,Mine are the night and morning||The pits of air| the gulf of space||The sportive sun| the gibbous moon||The innumerable days.|I hid in the solar glory||I am dumb in the pealing song||I rest on the pitch of the torrent||In slumber I am strong.|No numbers have counted my tallies||No tribes my house can fill||I sit by the shining Fount of Life||And pour the deluge still;|And ever by delicate powers|Gathering along the centuries|From race on race the rarest flowers||My wreath shall nothing miss.|And many a thousand summers|My apples ripened well||And light from meliorating stars|With firmer glory fell.|I wrote the past in characters|Of rock and fire the scroll||The building in the coral sea||The planting of the coal.|And thefts from satellites and rings|And broken stars I drew||And out of spent and aged things|I formed the world anew;|What time the gods kept carnival||Tricked out in star and flower||And in cramp elf and saurian forms|They swathed their too much power.|Time and Thought were my surveyors||They laid their courses well||They boiled the sea| and baked the layers|Or granite| marl| and shell.|But he| the man-child glorious|--|Where tarries he the while?|The rainbow shines his harbinger||The sunset gleams his smile.|My boreal lights leap upward||Forthright my planets roll||And still the man-child is not born||The summit of the whole.|Must time and tide forever run?|Will never my winds go sleep in the west?|Will never my wheels which whirl the sun|And satellites have rest?|Too much of donning and doffing||Too slow the rainbow fades||I weary of my robe of snow||My leaves and my cascades;|I tire of globes and races||Too long the game is played;|What without him is summer's pomp||Or winter's frozen shade?|I travail in pain for him||My creatures travail and wait;|His couriers come by squadrons||He comes not to the gate.|Twice I have moulded an image||And thrice outstretched my hand||Made one of day| and one of night||And one of the salt sea-sand.|One in a Judaean manger||And one by Avon stream||One over against the mouths of Nile||And one in the Academe.|I moulded kings and saviours||And bards o'er kings to rule;--|But fell the starry influence short||The cup was never full.|Yet whirl the glowing wheels once more||And mix the bowl again;|Seethe| fate! the ancient elements||Heat| cold| wet| dry| and peace| and pain.|Let war and trade and creeds and song|Blend| ripen race on race||The sunburnt world a man shall breed|Of all the zones| and countless days.|No ray is dimmed| no atom worn||My oldest force is good as new||And the fresh rose on yonder thorn|Gives back the bending heavens in dew.,Emerson Waldo,nature
Nature ,As a fond mother| when the day is o'er||Leads by the hand her little child to bed||Half willing| half reluctant to be led||And leave his broken playthings on the floor||Still gazing at them through the open door||Nor wholly reassured and comforted|By promises of others in their stead||Which though more splendid| may not please him more;|So Nature deals with us| and takes away|Our playthings one by one| and by the hand|Leads us to rest so gently| that we go|Scarce knowing if we wish to go or stay||Being too full of sleep to understand|How far the unknown transcends the what we know.,Longfellow Wadsworth,nature

Patience Taught By Nature ,'O DREARY life|' we cry| ' O dreary life ! '|And still the generations of the birds|Sing through our sighing| and the flocks and herds|Serenely live while we are keeping strife|With Heaven's true purpose in us| as a knife|Against which we may struggle ! Ocean girds|Unslackened the dry land| savannah-swards|Unweary sweep| hills watch unworn| and rife|Meek leaves drop year]y from the forest-trees|To show| above| the unwasted stars that pass|In their old glory: O thou God of old||Grant me some smaller grace than comes to these !--|But so much patience as a blade of grass|Grows by| contented through the heat and cold.,Browning Barrett,nature
Nature Is What You Dont See ,nature is what we dont see|for instance the essence that pushes words out|for this poem fated for posterity|the birds that without fail|chirp at first light| morn breeze|the unseen clock working at the dot|nature is what we dont see|the nocturnal bloom| that folds itself|in the day| throws its fragrance|in the dead of night as lovers|hide in each others' bossoms|below the soft glare of the moon|centimetre by centimetre|it has inched forward to exhibit its|full blown majestry to the world|Nature is what we dont see|the shadow play master tilting the earth|the petals for its bloom dance|the successive cells here there|guided towards optimal functions|and that ogiasmic tremour|that shuttles the world round and round|nature is what you should not see|the formulas| secrets kept behind everything|that could get even einstein mad|in unveiling| explaining them|nature is what we all should not see|nor equipped to see|though it rambles through our every cell|like the worst of storm,chunghoo tiong,nature
God's Gift ,When the beautiful morning comes|The rays of rising sun kiss her|When the garden of nature open its heart|The garden of flowers hugs her to welcome|When the trees dance to tune of wind|The birds singing to the nature's choir|When the gentleness of nature is filled pleasure|Then the earth get wet with weather|When the nature forgets its vastness|Then the God shows her how big her place on earth|Let us thank God for his creation and given us|eyes to see lovely gift - Nature,Sathasivam Ravi,nature
Amends To Nature ,I have loved colours| and not flowers;|Their motion| not the swallows wings;|And wasted more than half my hours|Without the comradeship of things.|How is it| now| that I can see||With love and wonder and delight||The children of the hedge and tree||The little lords of day and night?|How is it that I see the roads||No longer with usurping eyes||A twilight meeting-place for toads||A mid-day mart for butterflies?|I feel| in every midge that hums||Life| fugitive and infinite||And suddenly the world becomes|A part of me and I of it.,Symons Arthur,nature

Nature That Washed Her Hands In Milk ,Nature| that washed her hands in milk||And had forgot to dry them||Instead of earth took snow and silk||At love's request to try them||If she a mistress could compose|To please love's fancy out of those.|Her eyes he would should be of light||A violet breath| and lips of jelly;|Her hair not black| nor overbright||And of the softest down her belly;|As for her inside he'd have it|Only of wantonness and wit.|At love's entreaty such a one|Nature made| but with her beauty|She hath framed a heart of stone;|So as Love| by ill destiny||Must die for her whom nature gave him|Because her darling would not save him.|But time| which nature doth despise|And rudely gives her love the lie||Makes hope a fool| and sorrow wise||His hands do neither wash nor dry;|But being made of steel and rust||Turns snow and silk and milk to dust.|The light| the belly| lips| and breath||He dims| discolors| and destroys;|With those he feeds but fills not death||Which sometimes were the food of joys.|Yea| time doth dull each lively wit||And dries all wantonness with it.|Oh| cruel time| which takes in trust|Our youth| or joys| and all we have||And pays us but with age and dust;|Who in the dark and silent grave|When we have wandered all our ways|Shuts up the story of our days.,Raleigh Walter,nature
Nature ,Full of rebellion| I would die||Or fight| or travel| or deny|That thou has aught to do with me.|O tame my heart;|It is thy highest art|To captivate strong holds to thee.|If thou shalt let this venom lurk||And in suggestions fume and work||My soul will turn to bubbles straight||And thence by kind|Vanish into a wind||Making thy workmanship deceit.|O smooth my rugged heart| and there|Engrave thy rev'rend law and fear;|Or make a new one| since the old|Is sapless grown||And a much fitter stone|To hide my dust| than thee to hold.,Herbert George,nature
The Gladness Of Nature ,Is this a time to be cloudy and sad||When our mother Nature laughs around;|When even the deep blue heavens look glad||And gladness breathes from the blossoming ground?|There are notes of joy from the hang-bird and wren||And the gossip of swallows through all the sky;|The ground-squirrel gaily chirps by his den||And the wilding bee hums merrily by.|The clouds are at play in the azure space||And their shadows at play on the bright green vale||And here they stretch to the frolic chase||And there they roll on the easy gale.|There's a dance of leaves in that aspen bower||There's a titter of winds in that beechen tree||There's a smile on the fruit| and a smile on the flower||And a laugh from the brook that runs to the sea.|And look at the broad-faced sun| how he smiles|On the dewy earth that smiles in his ray||On the leaping waters and gay young isles;|Ay| look| and he'll smile thy gloom away.,Bryant Cullen,nature
The Interpretation Of Nature And ,I.|MAN| being the servant and interpreter of Nature| can do and understand so much and so much only as he has observed in fact or in thought of the course of nature: beyond this he neither knows anything nor can do anything.|II.|Neither the naked hand nor the understanding left to itself can effect much. It is by instruments and helps that the work is done| which are as much wanted for the understanding as for the hand. And as the instruments of the hand either give motion or guide it| so the instruments of the mind supply either suggestions for the understanding or cautions.|III.|Human knowledge and human power meet in one; for where the cause is not known the effect cannot be produced. Nature to be commanded must be obeyed; and that which in contemplation is as the cause is in operation as the rule.|IV.|Towards the effecting of works| all that man can do is to put together or put asunder natural bodies. The rest is done by nature working within.|V.|The study of nature with a view to works is engaged in by the mechanic| the mathematician| the physician| the alchemist| and the magician; but by all (as things now are) with slight endeavour and scanty success.|VI.|It would be an unsound fancy and self-contradictory to expect that things which have never yet been done can be done except by means which have never yet been tried.|VII.|The productions of the mind and hand seem very numerous in books and manufactures. But all this variety lies in an exquisite subtlety and derivations from a few things already known; not in the number of axioms.|VIII.|Moreover the works already known are due to chance and experiment rather than to sciences; for the sciences we now possess are merely systems for the nice ordering and setting forth of things already invented; not methods of invention or directions for new works.|IX.|The cause and root of nearly all evils in the sciences is this -- that while we falsely admire and extol the powers of the human mind we neglect to seek for its true helps.|X.|The subtlety of nature is greater many times over than the subtlety of the senses and understanding; so that all those specious meditations| speculations| and glosses in which men indulge are quite from the purpose| only there is no one by to observe it.|XI.|As the sciences which we now have do not help us in finding out new works| so neither does the logic which we now have help us in finding out new sciences.|XII.|The logic now in use serves rather to fix and give stability to the errors which have their foundation in commonly received notions than to help the search after truth. So it does more harm than good.|XIII.|The syllogism is not applied to the first principles of sciences| and is applied in vain to intermediate axioms; being no match for the subtlety of nature. It commands assent therefore to the proposition| but does not take hold of the thing.|XIV.|The syllogism consists of propositions| propositions consist of words| words are symbols of notions. Therefore if the notions themselves (which is the root of the matter) are confused and over-hastily abstracted from the facts| there can be no firmness in the superstructure. Our only hope therefore lies in a true induction.|XV.|There is no soundness in our notions whether logical or physical. Substance| Quality| Action| Passion| Essence itself| are not sound notions: much less are Heavy| Light| Dense| Rare| Moist| Dry| Generation| Corruption| Attraction| Repulsion| Element| Matter| Form| and the like; but all are fantastical and ill defined.|XVI.|Our notions of less general species| as Man| Dog| Dove| and of the immediate perceptions of the sense| as Hot| Cold| Black| White| do not materially mislead us; yet even these are sometimes confused by the flux and alteration of matter and the mixing of one thing with another. All the others which men have hitherto adopted are but wanderings| not being abstracted and formed from things by proper methods.|XVII.|Nor is there less of wilfulness and wandering in the construction of axioms than in the formations of notions; not excepting even those very principles which are obtained by common induction; but much more in the axioms and lower propositions educed by the syllogism.|XVIII.|The discoveries which have hitherto been made in the sciences are such as lie close to vulgar notions| scarcely beneath the surface. In order to penetrate into the inner and further recesses of nature| it is necessary that both notions and axioms be derived from things by a more sure and guarded way; and that a method of intellectual operation be introduced altogether better and more certain.|XIX.|There are and can be only two ways of searching into and discovering truth. The one flies from the senses and particulars to the most general axioms| and from these principles| the truth of which it takes for settled and immovable| proceeds to judgment and to the discovery of middle axioms. And this way is now in fashion. The other derives axioms from the senses and particulars| rising by a gradual and unbroken ascent| so that it arrives at the most general axioms last of all. This is the true way| but as yet untried.|XX.|The understanding left to itself takes the same course (namely| the former) which it takes in accordance with logical order. For the mind longs to spring up to positions of higher generality| that it may find rest there; and so after a little while wearies of experiment. But this evil is increased by logic| because of the order and solemnity of its disputations.|XXI.|The understanding left to itself| in a sober| patient| and grave mind| especially if it be not hindered by received doctrines| tries a little that other way| which is the right one| but with little progress; since the understanding| unless directed and assisted| is a thing unequal| and quite unfit to contend with the obscurity of things.|XXII.|Both ways set out from the senses and particulars| and rest in the highest generalities; but the difference between them is infinite. For the one just glances at experiment and particulars in passing| the other dwells duly and orderly among them. The one| again| begins at once by establishing certain abstract and useless generalities| the other rises by gradual steps to that which is prior and better known in the order of nature.|XXIII.|There is a great difference between the Idols of the human mind and the Ideas of the divine. That is to say| between certain empty dogmas| and the true signatures and marks set upon the works of creation as they are found in nature.|XXIV.|It cannot be that axioms established by argumentation should avail for the discovery of new works; since the subtlety of nature is greater many times over than the subtlety of argument. But axioms duly and orderly formed from particulars easily discover the way to new particulars| and thus render sciences active.|XXV.|The axioms now in use| having been suggested by a scanty and manipular experience and a few particulars of most general occurrence| are made for the most part just large enough to fit and take these in: and therefore it is no wonder if they do not lead to new particulars. And if some opposite instance| not observed or not known before| chance to come in the way| the axiom is rescued and preserved by some frivolous distinction; whereas the truer course would be to correct the axiom itself.|XXVI.|The conclusions of human reason as ordinarily applied in matter of nature| I call for the sake of distinction Anticipations of Nature (as a thing rash or premature). That reason which is elicited from facts by a just and methodical process| I call Interpretation of Nature.|XXVII.|Anticipations are a ground sufficiently firm for consent; for even if men went mad all after the same fashion| they might agree one with another well enough.|XXVIII.|For the winning of assent| indeed| anticipations are far more powerful than interpretations; because being collected from a few instances| and those for the most part of familiar occurrence| they straightway touch the understanding and fill the imagination; whereas interpretations on the other hand| being gathered here and there from very various and widely dispersed facts| cannot suddenly strike the understanding; and therefore they must needs| in respect of the opinions of the time| seem harsh and out of tune; much as the mysteries of faith do.|XXIX.|In sciences founded on opinions and dogmas| the use of anticipations and logic is good; for in them the object is to command assent to the proposition| not to master the thing.|XXX.|Though all the wits of all the ages should meet together and combine and transmit their labours| yet will no great progress ever be made in science by means of anticipations; because radical errors in the first concoction of the mind are not to be cured by the excellence of functions and remedies subsequent.|XXXI.|It is idle to expect any great advancement in science from the superinducing and engrafting of new things upon old. We must begin anew from the very foundations| unless we would revolve for ever in a circle with mean and contemptible progress.|XXXII.|The honour of the ancient authors| and indeed of all| remains untouched; since the comparison I challenge is not of wits or faculties| but of ways and methods| and the part I take upon myself is not that of a judge| but of a guide.|XXXIII.|This must be plainly avowed: no judgment can be rightly formed either of my method or of the discoveries to which it leads| by means of anticipations (that is to say| of the reasoning which is now in use); since I cannot be called on to abide by the sentence of a tribunal which is itself on its trial.|XXXIV.|Even to deliver and explain what I bring forward is no easy matter; for things in themselves new will yet be apprehended with reference to what is old.|XXXV.|It was said by Borgia of the expedition of the French into Italy| that they came with chalk in their hands to mark out their lodgings| not with arms to force their way in. I in like manner would have my doctrine enter quietly into the minds that are fit and capable of receiving it; for confutations cannot be employed| when the difference is upon first principles and very notions and even upon forms of demonstration.|XXXVI.|One method of delivery alone remains to us; which is simply this: we must lead men to the particulars themselves| and their series and order; while men on their side must force themselves for awhile to lay their notions by and begin to familiarise themselves with facts.|XXXVII.|The doctrine of those who have denied that certainty could be attained at all| has some agreement with my way of proceeding at the first setting out; but they end in being infinitely separated and opposed. For the holders of that doctrine assert simply that nothing can be known; I also assert that not much can be known in nature by the way which is now in use. But then they go on to destroy the authority of the senses and understanding; whereas I proceed to devise and supply helps for the same.|XXXVIII.|The idols and false notions which are now in possession of the human understanding| and have taken deep root therein| not only so beset men's minds that truth can hardly find entrance| but even after entrance obtained| they will again in the very instauration of the sciences meet and trouble us| unless men being forewarned of the danger fortify themselves as far as may be against their assaults.|XXXIX.|There are four classes of Idols which beset men's minds. To these for distinction's sake I have assigned names| -- calling the first class Idols of the Tribe; the second| Idols of the Cave; the third| Idols of the Market-place; the fourth| Idols of the Theatre.|XL.|The formation of ideas and axioms by true induction is no doubt the proper remedy to be applied for the keeping off and clearing away of idols. To point them out| however| is of great use; for the doctrine of Idols is to the Interpretation of Nature what the doctrine of the refutation of Sophisms is to common Logic.|XLI.|The Idols of the Tribe have their foundation in human nature itself| and in the tribe or race of men. For it is a false assertion that the sense of man is the measure of things. On the contrary| all perceptions as well of the sense as of the mind are according to the measure of the individual and not according to the measure of the universe. And the human understanding is like a false mirror| which| receiving rays irregularly| distorts and discolours the nature of things by mingling its own nature with it.|XLII.|The Idols of the Cave are the idols of the individual man. For every one (besides the errors common to human nature in general) has a cave or den of his own| which refracts and discolours the light of nature; owing either to his own proper and peculiar nature; or to his education and conversation with others; or to the reading of books| and the authority of those whom he esteems and admires; or to the differences of impressions| accordingly as they take place in a mind preoccupied and predisposed or in a mind indifferent and settled; or the like. So that the spirit of man (according as it is meted out to different individuals) is in fact a thing variable and full of perturbation| and governed as it were by chance. Whence it was well observed by Heraclitus that men look for sciences in their own lesser worlds| and not in the greater or common world.|XLIII.|There are also Idols formed by the intercourse and association of men with each other| which I call Idols of the Market-place| on account of the commerce and consort of men there. For it is by discourse that men associate; and words are imposed according to the apprehension of the vulgar. And therefore the ill and unfit choice of words wonderfully obstructs the understanding. Nor do the definitions or explanations wherewith in some things learned men are wont to guard and defend themselves| by any means set the matter right. But words plainly force and overrule the understanding| and throw all into confusion| and lead men away into numberless empty controversies and idle fancies.|XLIV.|Lastly| there are Idols which have immigrated into men's minds from the various dogmas of philosophies| and also from wrong laws of demonstration. These I call Idols of the Theatre; because in my judgment all the received systems are but so many stage-plays| representing worlds of their own creation after an unreal and scenic fashion. Nor is it only of the systems now in vogue| or only of the ancient sects and philosophies| that I speak; for many more plays of the same kind may yet be composed and in like artificial manner set forth; seeing that errors the most widely different have nevertheless causes for the most part alike. Neither again do I mean this only of entire systems| but also of many principles and axioms in science| which by tradition| credulity| and negligence have come to be received.|But of these several kinds of Idols I must speak more largely and exactly| that the understanding may be duly cautioned.|XLV.|The human understanding is of its own nature prone to suppose the existence of more order and regularity in the world than it finds. And though there be many things in nature which are singular and unmatched| yet it devises for them parallels and conjugates and relatives which do not exist. Hence the fiction that all celestial bodies move in perfect circles; spirals and dragons being (except in name) utterly rejected. Hence too the element of Fire with its orb is brought in| to make up the square with the other three which the sense perceives. Hence also the ratio of density of the so-called elements is arbitrarily fixed at ten to one. And so on of other dreams. And these fancies affect not dogmas only| but simple notions also.|XLVI.|The human understanding when it has once adopted an opinion (either as being the received opinion or as being agreeable to itself) draws all things else to support and agree with it. And though there be a greater number and weight of instances to be found on the other side| yet these it either neglects and despises| or else by some distinction sets aside and rejects; in order that by this great and pernicious predetermination the authority of its former conclusions may remain inviolate. And therefore it was a good answer that was made by one who when they showed him hanging in a temple a picture of those who had paid their vows as having escaped shipwreck| and would have him say whether he did not now acknowledge the power of the gods| -- "Aye|" asked he again| "but where are they painted that were drowned after their vows?" And such is the way of all superstition| whether in astrology| dreams| omens| divine judgments| or the like; wherein men| having a delight in such vanities| mark the events where they are fulfilled| but where they fail| though this happen much oftener| neglect and pass them by. But with far more subtlety does this mischief insinuate itself into philosophy and the sciences; in which the first conclusion colours and brings into conformity with itself all that come after| though far sounder and better. Besides| independently of that delight and vanity which I have described| it is the peculiar and perpetual error of the human intellect to be more moved and excited by affirmatives than by negatives; whereas it ought properly to hold itself indifferently disposed towards both alike. Indeed in the establishment of any true axiom| the negative instance is the more forcible of the two.|XLVII.|The human understanding is moved by those things most which strike and enter the mind simultaneously and suddenly| and so fill the imagination; and then it feigns and supposes all other things to be somehow| though it cannot see how| similar to those few things by which it is surrounded. But for that going to and fro to remote and heterogeneous instances| by which axioms are tried as in the fire| the intellect is altogether slow and unfit| unless it be forced thereto by severe laws and overruling authority.|XLVIII.|The human understanding is unquiet; it cannot stop or rest| and still presses onward| but in vain. Therefore it is that we cannot conceive of any end or limit to the world; but always as of necessity it occurs to us that there is something beyond. Neither again can it be conceived how eternity has flowed down to the present day; for that distinction which is commonly received of infinity in time past and in time to come can by no means hold; for it would thence follow that one infinity is greater than another| and that infinity is wasting away and tending to become finite. The like subtlety arises touching the infinite divisibility of lines| from the same inability of thought to stop. But this inability interferes more mischievously in the discovery of causes: for although the most general principles in nature ought to be held merely positive| as they are discovered| and cannot with truth be referred to a cause; nevertheless the human understanding being unable to rest still seeks something prior in the order of nature. And then it is that in struggling towards that which is further off it falls back upon that which is more nigh at hand; namely| on final causes: which have relation clearly to the nature of man rather than to the nature of the universe; and from this source have strangely defiled philosophy. But he is no less an unskilled and shallow philosopher who seeks causes of that which is most general| than he who in things subordinate and subaltern omits to do so.|XLIX.|The human understanding is no dry light| but receives an infusion from the will and affections; whence proceed sciences which may be called "sciences as one would." For what a man had rather were true he more readily believes. Therefore he rejects difficult things from impatience of research; sober things| because they narrow hope; the deeper things of nature| from superstition; the light of experience| from arrogance and pride| lest his mind should seem to be occupied with things mean and transitory; things not commonly believed| out of deference to the opinion of the vulgar. Numberless in short are the ways| and sometimes imperceptible| in which the affections colour and infect the understanding.|L.|But by far the greatest hindrance and aberration of the human understanding proceeds from the dullness| incompetency| and deceptions of the senses; in that things which strike the sense outweigh things which do not immediately strike it| though they be more important. Hence it is that speculation commonly ceases where sight ceases; insomuch that of things invisible there is little or no observation. Hence all the working of the spirits inclosed in tangible bodies lies hid and unobserved of men. So also all the more subtle changes of form in the parts of coarser substances (which they commonly call alteration| though it is in truth local motion through exceedingly small spaces) is in like manner unobserved. And yet unless these two things just mentioned be searched out and brought to light| nothing great can be achieved in nature| as far as the production of works is concerned. So again the essential nature of our common air| and of all bodies less dense than air (which are very many)| is almost unknown. For the sense by itself is a thing infirm and erring; neither can instruments for enlarging or sharpening the senses do much; but all the truer kind of interpretation of nature is effected by instances and experiments fit and apposite; wherein the sense decides touching the experiment only| and the experiment touching the point in nature and the thing itself.|LI.|The human understanding is of its own nature prone to abstractions and gives a substance and reality to things which are fleeting. But to resolve nature into abstractions is less to our purpose than to dissect her into parts; as did the school of Democritus| which went further into nature than the rest. Matter rather than forms should be the object of our attention| its configurations and changes of configuration| and simple action| and law of action or motion; for forms are figments of the human mind| unless you will call those laws of action forms.|LII.|Such then are the idols which I call Idols of the Tribe; and which take their rise either from the homogeneity of the substance of the human spirit| or from its preoccupation| or from its narrowness| or from its restless motion| or from an infusion of the affections| or from the incompetency of the senses| or from the mode of impression.|LIII.|The Idols of the Cave take their rise in the peculiar constitution| mental or bodily| of each individual; and also in education| habit| and accident. Of this kind there is a great number and variety; but I will instance those the pointing out of which contains the most important caution| and which have most effect in disturbing the clearness of the understanding.|LIV.|Men become attached to certain particular sciences and speculations| either because they fancy themselves the authors and inventors thereof| or because they have bestowed the greatest pains upon them and become most habituated to them. But men of this kind| if they betake themselves to philosophy and contemplations of a general character| distort and colour them in obedience to their former fancies; a thing especially to be noticed in Aristotle| who made his natural philosophy a mere bond-servant to his logic| thereby rendering it contentious and well nigh useless. The race of chemists again out of a few experiments of the furnace have built up a fantastic philosophy| framed with reference to a few things; and Gilbert also| after he had employed himself most laboriously in the study and observation of the loadstone| proceeded at once to construct an entire system in accordance with his favourite subject.|LV.|There is one principal and as it were radical distinction between different minds| in respect of philosophy and the sciences; which is this: that some minds are stronger and apter to mark the differences of things| others to mark their resemblances. The steady and acute mind can fix its contemplations and dwell and fasten on the subtlest distinctions: the lofty and discursive mind recognises and puts together the finest and most general resemblances. Both kinds however easily err in excess| by catching the one at gradations the other at shadows.|LVI.|There are found some minds given to an extreme admiration of antiquity| others to an extreme love and appetite for novelty: but few so duly tempered that they can hold the mean| neither carping at what has been well laid down by the ancients| nor despising what is well introduced by the moderns. This however turns to the great injury of the sciences and philosophy; since these affectations of antiquity and novelty are the humours of partisans rather than judgments; and truth is to be sought for not in the felicity of any age| which is an unstable thing| but in the light of nature and experience| which is eternal. These factions therefore must be abjured| and care must be taken that the intellect be not hurried by them into assent.|LVII.|Contemplations of nature and of bodies in their simple form break up and distract the understanding| while contemplations of nature and bodies in their composition and configuration overpower and dissolve the understanding: a distinction well seen in the school of Leucippus and Democritus as compared with the other philosophies. For that school is so busied with the particles that it hardly attends to the structure; while the others are so lost in admiration of the structure that they do not penetrate to the simplicity of nature. These kinds of contemplation should therefore be alternated and taken by turns; that so the understanding may be rendered at once penetrating and comprehensive| and the inconveniences above mentioned| with the idols which proceed from them| may be avoided.|LVIII.|Let such then be our provision and contemplative prudence for keeping off and dislodging the Idols of the Cave| which grow for the most part either out of the predominance of a favourite subject| or out of an excessive tendency to compare or to distinguish| or out of partiality for particular ages| or out of the largeness or minuteness of the objects contemplated. And generally let every student of nature take this as a rule| -- that whatever his mind seizes and dwells upon with peculiar satisfaction is to be held in suspicion| and that so much the more care is to be taken in dealing with such questions to keep the understanding even and clear.|LIX.|But the Idols of the Market-place are the most troublesome of all: idols which have crept into the understanding through the alliances of words and names. For men believe that their reason governs words; but it is also true that words react on the understanding; and this it is that has rendered philosophy and the sciences sophistical and inactive. Now words| being commonly framed and applied according to the capacity of the vulgar| follow those lines of division which are most obvious to the vulgar understanding. And whenever an understanding of greater acuteness or a more diligent observation would alter those lines to suit the true divisions of nature| words stand in the way and resist the change. Whence it comes to pass that the high and formal discussions of learned men end oftentimes in disputes about words and names; with which (according to the use and wisdom of the mathematicians) it would be more prudent to begin| and so by means of definitions reduce them to order. Yet even definitions cannot cure this evil in dealing with natural and material things; since the definitions themselves consist of words| and those words beget others: so that it is necessary to recur to individual instances| and those in due series and order; as I shall say presently when I come to the method and scheme for the formation of notions and axioms.|LX.|The idols imposed by words on the understanding are of two kinds. They are either names of things which do not exist (for as there are things left unnamed through lack of observation| so likewise are there names which result from fantastic suppositions and to which nothing in reality corresponds)| or they are names of things which exist| but yet confused and ill-defined| and hastily and irregularly derived from realities. Of the former kind are Fortune| the Prime Mover| Planetary Orbits| Element of Fire| and like fictions which owe their origin to false and idle theories. And this class of idols is more easily expelled| because to get rid of them it is only necessary that all theories should be steadily rejected and dismissed as obsolete.|But the other class| which springs out of a faulty and unskilful abstraction| is intricate and deeply rooted. Let us take for example such a word as humid; and see how far the several things which the word is used to signify agree with each other; and we shall find the word humid to be nothing else than a mark loosely and confusedly applied to denote a variety of actions which will not bear to be reduced to any constant meaning. For it both signifies that which easily spreads itself round any other body; and that which in itself is indeterminate and cannot solidise; and that which readily yields in every direction; and that which easily divides and scatters itself; and that which easily unites and collects itself; and that which readily flows and is put in motion; and that which readily clings to another body and wets it; and that which is easily reduced to a liquid| or being solid easily melts. Accordingly when you come to apply the word| -- if you take it in one sense| flame is humid; if in another| air is not humid; if in another| fine dust is humid; if in another| glass is humid. So that it is easy to see that the notion is taken by abstraction only from water and common and ordinary liquids| without any due verification.|There are however in words certain degrees of distortion and error. One of the least faulty kinds is that of names of substances| especially of lowest species and well-deduced (for the notion of chalk and of mud is good| of earth bad); a more faulty kind is that of actions| as to generate| to corrupt| to alter; the most faulty is of qualities (except such as are the immediate objects of the sense) as heavy| light| rare| dense| and the like. Yet in all these cases some notions are of necessity a little better than others| in proportion to the greater variety of subjects that fall within the range of the human sense.|LXI.|But the Idols of the Theatre are not innate| nor do they steal into the understanding secretly| but are plainly impressed and received into the mind from the play-books of philosophical systems and the perverted rules of demonstration. To attempt refutations in this case would be merely inconsistent with what I have already said: for since we agree neither upon principles nor upon demonstrations there is no place for argument. And this is so far well| inasmuch as it leaves the honour of the ancients untouched. For they are no wise disparaged the question between them and me being only as to the way. For as the saying is| the lame man who keeps the right road outstrips the runner who takes a wrong one. Nay it is obvious that when a man runs the wrong way| the more active and swift he is the further he will go astray.|But the course I propose for the discovery of sciences is such as leaves but little to the acuteness and strength of wits| but places all wits and understandings nearly on a level. For as in the drawing of a straight line or a perfect circle| much depends on the steadiness and practice of the hand| if it be done by aim of hand only| but if with the aid of rule or compass| little or nothing; so is it exactly with my plan. But though particular confutations would be of no avail| yet touching the sects and general divisions of such systems I must say something; something also touching the external signs which show that they are unsound; and finally something touching the causes of such great infelicity and of such lasting and general agreement in error; that so the access to truth may be made less difficult| and the human understanding may the more willingly submit to its purgation and dismiss its idols.|LXII.|Idols of the Theatre| or of Systems| are many| and there can be and perhaps will be yet many more. For were it not that new for many ages men's minds have been busied with religion and theology; and were it not that civil governments| especially monarchies| have been averse to such novelties| even in matters speculative; so that men labour therein to the peril and harming of their fortunes| -- not only unrewarded| but exposed also to contempt and envy; doubtless there would have arisen many other philosophical sects like to those which in great variety flourished once among the Greeks. For as on the phenomena of the heavens many hypotheses may be constructed| so likewise (and more also) many various dogmas may be set up and established on the phenomena of philosophy. And in the plays of this philosophical theatre you may observe the same thing which is found in the theatre of the poets| that stories invented for the stage are more compact and elegant| and more as one would wish them to be| than true stories out of history.|In general however there is taken for the material of philosophy either a great deal out of a few things| or a very little out of many things; so that on both sides philosophy is based on too narrow a foundation of experiment and natural history| and decides on the authority of too few cases. For the Rational School of philosophers snatches from experience a variety of common instances| neither duly ascertained nor diligently examined and weighed| and leaves all the rest to meditation and agitation of wit.|There is also another class of philosophers| who having bestowed much diligent and careful labour on a few experiments| have thence made bold to educe and construct systems; wresting all other facts in a strange fashion to conformity therewith.|And there is yet a third class| consisting of those who out of faith and veneration mix their philosophy with theology and traditions; among whom the vanity of some has gone so far aside as to seek the origin of sciences among spirits and genii. So that this parent stock of errors -- this false philosophy -- is of three kinds; the Sophistical| the Empirical| and the Superstitious.|LXIII.|The most conspicuous example of the first class was Aristotle| who corrupted natural philosophy by his logic: fashioning the world out of categories; assigning to the human soul| the noblest of substances| a genus from words of the second intention; doing the business of density and rarity (which is to make bodies of greater or less dimensions| that is| occupy greater or less spaces)| by the frigid distinction of act and power; asserting that single bodies have each a single and proper motion| and that if they participate in any other| then this results from an external cause; and imposing countless other arbitrary restrictions on the nature of things; being always more solicitous to provide an answer to the question and affirm something positive in words| than about the inner truth of things; a failing best shown when his philosophy is compared with other systems of note among the Greeks. For the Homoeomera of Anaxagoras; the Atoms of Leucippus and Democritus; the Heaven and Earth of Parmenides; the Strife and Friendship of Empedocles; Heraclitus's doctrine how bodies are resolved into the indifferent nature of fire| and remoulded into solids; have all of them some taste of the natural philosopher| -- some savour of the nature of things| and experience| and bodies; whereas in the physics of Aristotle you hear hardly anything but the words of logic; which in his metaphysics also| under a more imposing name| and more forsooth as a realist than a nominalist| he has handled over again. Nor let any weight be given to the fact| that in his books on animals and his problems| and other of his treatises| there is frequent dealing with experiments. For he had come to his conclusion before; he did not consult experience| as he should have done| in order to the framing of his decisions and axioms; but having first determined the question according to his will| he then resorts to experience| and bending her into conformity with his placets leads her about like a captive in a procession; so that even on this count he is more guilty than his modern followers| the schoolmen| who have abandoned experience altogether.|LXIV.|But the Empirical school of philosophy gives birth to dogmas more deformed and monstrous than the Sophistical or Rational school. For it has its foundations not in the light of common notions| (which though it be a faint and superficial light| is yet in a manner universal| and has reference to many things|) but in the narrowness and darkness of a few experiments. To those therefore who are daily busied with these experiments| and have infected their imagination with them| such a philosophy seems probable and all but certain; to all men else incredible and vain. Of this there is a notable instance in the alchemists and their dogmas; though it is hardly to be found elsewhere in these times| except perhaps in the philosophy of Gilbert. Nevertheless with regard to philosophies of this kind there is one caution not to be omitted; for I foresee that if ever men are roused by my admonitions to betake themselves seriously to experiment and bid farewell to sophistical doctrines| then indeed through the premature hurry of the understanding to leap or fly to universals and principles of things| great danger may be apprehended from philosophies of this kind; against which evil we ought even now to prepare.|LXV.|But the corruption of philosophy by superstition and an admixture of theology is far more widely spread| and does the greatest harm| whether to entire systems or to their parts. For the human understanding is obnoxious to the influence of the imagination no less than to the influence of common notions. For the contentious and sophistical kind of philosophy ensnares the understanding; but this kind| being fanciful and timid and half poetical| misleads it more by flattery. For there is in man an ambition of the understanding| no less than of the will| especially in high and lofty spirits.|Of this kind we have among the Greeks a striking example in Pythagoras| though he united with it a coarser and more cumbrous superstition; another in Plato and his school| more dangerous and subtle. It shows itself likewise in parts of other philosophies| in the introduction of abstract forms and final causes and first causes| with the omission in most cases of causes intermediate| and the like. Upon this point the greatest caution should be used. For nothing is so mischievous as the apotheosis of error; and it is a very plague of the understanding for vanity to become the object of veneration. Yet in this vanity some of the moderns have with extreme levity indulged so far as to attempt to found a system of natural philosophy on the first chapter of Genesis| on the book of Job| and other parts of the sacred writings; seeking for the dead among the living: which also makes the inhibition and repression of it the more important| because from this unwholesome mixture of things human and divine there arises not only a fantastic philosophy but also an heretical religion. Very meet it is therefore that we be sober-minded| and give to faith that only which is faith's.|LXVI.|So much then for the mischievous authorities of systems| which are founded either on common notions| or on a few experiments| or on superstition. It remains to speak of the faulty subject-matter of contemplations| especially in natural philosophy. Now the human understanding is infected by the sight of what takes place in the mechanical arts| in which the alteration of bodies proceeds chiefly by composition or separation| and so imagines that something similar goes on in the universal nature of things. From this source has flowed the fiction of elements| and of their concourse for the formation of natural bodies. Again| when man contemplates nature working freely| he meets with different species of things| of animals| of plants| of minerals; whence he readily passes into the opinion that there are in nature certain primary forms which nature intends to educe| and that the remaining variety proceeds from hindrances and aberrations of nature in the fulfilment of her work| or from the collision of different species and the transplanting of one into another. To the first of these speculations we owe our primary qualities of the elements; to the other our occult properties and specific virtues; and both of them belong to those empty compendia of thought wherein the mind rests| and whereby it is diverted from more solid pursuits. It is to better purpose that the physicians bestow their labour on the secondary qualities of matter| and the operations of attraction| repulsion| attenuation| conspissation| dilatation| astriction| dissipation| maturation| and the like; and were it not that by those two compendia which I have mentioned (elementary qualities| to wit| and specific virtues) they corrupted their correct observations in these other matters| -- either reducing them to first qualities and their subtle and incommensurable mixtures| or not following them out with greater and more diligent observation to third and fourth qualities| but breaking off the scrutiny prematurely| -- they had made much greater progress. Nor are powers of this kind (I do not say the same| but similar) to be sought for only in the medicines of the human body| but also in the changes of all other bodies.|But it is a far greater evil that they make the quiescent principles| wherefrom| and not the moving principles| whereby| things are produced| the object of their contemplation and inquiry. For the former tend to discourse| the latter to works. Nor is there any value in those vulgar distinctions of motion which are observed in the received system of natural philosophy| as generation| corruption| augmentation| diminution| alteration| and local motion. What they mean no doubt is this: -- if a body| in other respects not changed| be moved from its place| this is local motion; if without change of place or essence| it be changed in quality| this is alteration; if by reason of the change the mass and quantity of the body do not remain the same| this is augmentation or diminution; if they be changed to such a degree that they change their very essence and substance and turn to something else| this is generation and corruption. But all this is merely popular| and does not at all go deep into nature; for these are only measures and limits| not kinds of motion. What they intimate is how far| not by what means| or from what source. For they do not suggest anything with regard either to the desires of bodies or to the development of their parts: it is only when that motion presents the thing grossly and palpably to the sense as different from what it was| that they begin to mark the division. Even when they wish to suggest something with regard to the causes of motion| and to establish a division with reference to them| they introduce with the greatest negligence a distinction between motion natural and violent; a distinction which is itself drawn entirely from a vulgar notion| since all violent motion is also in fact natural; the external efficient simply setting nature working otherwise than it was before. But if| leaving all this| any one shall observe (for instance) that there is in bodies a desire of mutual contact| so as not to suffer the unity of nature to be quite separated or broken and a vacuum thus made; or if any one say that there is in bodies a desire of resuming their natural dimensions or tension| so that if compressed within or extended beyond them| they immediately strive to recover themselves| and fall back to their old volume and extent; or if any one say that there is in bodies a desire of congregating towards masses of kindred nature| -- of dense bodies| for instance| towards the globe of the earth| of thin and rare bodies towards the compass of the sky; all these and the like are truly physical kinds of motion; -- but those others are entirely logical and scholastic| as is abundantly manifest from this comparison.|Nor again is it a less evil| that in their philosophies and contemplations their labour is spent in investigating and handling the first principles of things and the highest generalities of nature; whereas utility and the means of working result entirely from things intermediate. Hence it is that men cease not from abstracting nature till they come to potential and uninformed matter| nor on the other hand from dissecting nature till they reach the atom; things which| even if true| can do but little for the welfare of mankind.|LXVII.|A caution must also be given to the understanding against the intemperance which systems of philosophy manifest in giving or withholding assent; because intemperance of this kind seems to establish Idols and in some sort to perpetuate them| leaving no way open to reach and dislodge them.|This excess is of two kinds: the first being manifest in those who are ready in deciding| and render sciences dogmatic and magisterial; the other in those who deny that we can know anything| and so introduce a wandering kind of inquiry that leads to nothing; of which kinds the former subdues| the latter weakens the understanding. For the philosophy of Aristotle| after having by hostile confutations destroyed all the rest (as the Ottomans serve their brothers)| has laid down the law on all points; which done| he proceeds himself to raise new questions of his own suggestion| and dispose of them likewise; so that nothing may remain that is not certain and decided: a practice which holds and is in use among his successors.|The school of Plato| on the other hand| introduced Acatalepsia| at first in jest and irony| and in disdain of the older sophists| Protagoras| Hippias| and the rest| who were of nothing else so much ashamed as of seeming to doubt about anything. But the New Academy made a dogma of it| and held it as a tenet. And though their's is a fairer seeming way than arbitrary decisions; since they say that they by no means destroy all investigation| like Pyrrho and his Refrainers| but allow of some things to be followed as probable| though of none to be maintained as true; yet still when the human mind has once despaired of finding truth| its interest in all things grows fainter; and the result is that men turn aside to pleasant disputations and discourses and roam as it were from object to object| rather than keep on a course of severe inquisition. But| as I said at the beginning and am ever urging| the human senses and understanding| weak as they are| are not to be deprived of their authority| but to be supplied with helps.|LXVIII.|So much concerning the several classes of Idols| and their equipage: all of which must be renounced and put away with a fixed and solemn determination| and the understanding thoroughly freed and cleansed; the entrance into the kingdom of man| founded on the sciences| being not much other than the entrance into the kingdom of heaven| whereinto none may enter except as a little child.,Bacon Francis,nature

Art Above Nature:  To Julia ,When I behold a forest spread|With silken trees upon thy head;|And when I see that other dress|Of flowers set in comeliness;|When I behold another grace|In the ascent of curious lace||Which| like a pinnacle| doth shew|The top| and the top-gallant too;|Then| when I see thy tresses bound|Into an oval| square| or round||And knit in knots far more than I.|Can tell by tongue| or True-love tie;|Next| when those lawny films I see|Play with a wild civility;|And all those airy silks to flow||Alluring me| and tempting so--|I must confess| mine eye and heart|Dotes less on nature than on art.,Herrick Robert,nature

Book Iii ,First| then| I say| the mind which oft we call|The intellect| wherein is seated life's|Counsel and regimen| is part no less|Of man than hand and foot and eyes are parts|Of one whole breathing creature. But some hold|That sense of mind is in no fixed part seated||But is of body some one vital state|-|Named "harmony" by Greeks| because thereby|We live with sense| though intellect be not|In any part: as oft the body is said|To have good health (when health| however| 's not|One part of him who has it)| so they place|The sense of mind in no fixed part of man.|Mightily| diversly| meseems they err.|Often the body palpable and seen|Sickens| while yet in some invisible part|We feel a pleasure; oft the other way||A miserable in mind feels pleasure still|Throughout his body- quite the same as when|A foot may pain without a pain in head.|Besides| when these our limbs are given o'er|To gentle sleep and lies the burdened frame|At random void of sense| a something else|Is yet within us| which upon that time|Bestirs itself in many a wise| receiving|All motions of joy and phantom cares of heart.|Now| for to see that in man's members dwells|Also the soul| and body ne'er is wont|To feel sensation by a "harmony"|Take this in chief: the fact that life remains|Oft in our limbs| when much of body's gone;|Yet that same life| when particles of heat||Though few| have scattered been| and through the mouth|Air has been given forth abroad| forthwith|Forever deserts the veins| and leaves the bones.|Thus mayst thou know that not all particles|Perform like parts| nor in like manner all|Are props of weal and safety: rather those-|The seeds of wind and exhalations warm-|Take care that in our members life remains.|Therefore a vital heat and wind there is|Within the very body| which at death|Deserts our frames. And so| since nature of mind|And even of soul is found to be| as 'twere||A part of man| give over "harmony"-|Name to musicians brought from Helicon|-|Unless themselves they filched it otherwise||To serve for what was lacking name till then.|Whate'er it be| they're welcome to it- thou||Hearken my other maxims.|Mind and soul||I say| are held conjoined one with other||And form one single nature of themselves;|But chief and regnant through the frame entire|Is still that counsel which we call the mind||And that cleaves seated in the midmost breast.|Here leap dismay and terror; round these haunts|Be blandishments of joys; and therefore here|The intellect| the mind. The rest of soul||Throughout the body scattered| but obeys-|Moved by the nod and motion of the mind.|This| for itself| sole through itself| hath thought;|This for itself hath mirth| even when the thing|That moves it| moves nor soul nor body at all.|And as| when head or eye in us is smit|By assailing pain| we are not tortured then|Through all the body| so the mind alone|Is sometimes smitten| or livens with a joy||Whilst yet the soul's remainder through the limbs|And through the frame is stirred by nothing new.|But when the mind is moved by shock more fierce||We mark the whole soul suffering all at once|Along man's members: sweats and pallors spread|Over the body| and the tongue is broken||And fails the voice away| and ring the ears||Mists blind the eyeballs| and the joints collapse|-|Aye| men drop dead from terror of the mind.|Hence| whoso will can readily remark|That soul conjoined is with mind| and| when|'Tis strook by influence of the mind| forthwith|In turn it hits and drives the body too.|And this same argument establisheth|That nature of mind and soul corporeal is:|For when 'tis seen to drive the members on||To snatch from sleep the body| and to change|The countenance| and the whole state of man|To rule and turn|- what yet could never be|Sans contact| and sans body contact fails-|Must we not grant that mind and soul consist|Of a corporeal nature?- And besides|Thou markst that likewise with this body of ours|Suffers the mind and with our body feels.|If the dire speed of spear that cleaves the bones|And bares the inner thews hits not the life||Yet follows a fainting and a foul collapse||And| on the ground| dazed tumult in the mind||And whiles a wavering will to rise afoot.|So nature of mind must be corporeal| since|From stroke and spear corporeal 'tis in throes.|Now| of what body| what components formed|Is this same mind I will go on to tell.|First| I aver| 'tis superfine| composed|Of tiniest particles- that such the fact|Thou canst perceive| if thou attend| from this:|Nothing is seen to happen with such speed|As what the mind proposes and begins;|Therefore the same bestirs itself more swiftly|Than aught whose nature's palpable to eyes.|But what's so agile must of seeds consist|Most round| most tiny| that they may be moved||When hit by impulse slight. So water moves||In waves along| at impulse just the least-|Being create of little shapes that roll;|But| contrariwise| the quality of honey|More stable is| its liquids more inert||More tardy its flow; for all its stock of matter|Cleaves more together| since| indeed| 'tis made|Of atoms not so smooth| so fine| and round.|For the light breeze that hovers yet can blow|High heaps of poppy-seed away for thee|Downward from off the top; but| contrariwise||A pile of stones or spiny ears of wheat|It can't at all. Thus| in so far as bodies|Are small and smooth| is their mobility;|But| contrariwise| the heavier and more rough||The more immovable they prove. Now| then||Since nature of mind is movable so much||Consist it must of seeds exceeding small|And smooth and round. Which fact once known to thee||Good friend| will serve thee opportune in else.|This also shows the nature of the same||How nice its texture| in how small a space|'Twould go| if once compacted as a pellet:|When death's unvexed repose gets hold on man|And mind and soul retire| thou markest there|From the whole body nothing ta'en in form||Nothing in weight. Death grants ye everything||But vital sense and exhalation hot.|Thus soul entire must be of smallmost seeds||Twined through the veins| the vitals| and the thews||Seeing that| when 'tis from whole body gone||The outward figuration of the limbs|Is unimpaired and weight fails not a whit.|Just so| when vanished the bouquet of wine||Or when an unguent's perfume delicate|Into the winds away departs| or when|From any body savour's gone| yet still|The thing itself seems minished naught to eyes||Thereby| nor aught abstracted from its weight-|No marvel| because seeds many and minute|Produce the savours and the redolence|In the whole body of the things. And so||Again| again| nature of mind and soul|'Tis thine to know created is of seeds|The tiniest ever| since at flying-forth|It beareth nothing of the weight away.|Yet fancy not its nature simple so.|For an impalpable aura| mixed with heat||Deserts the dying| and heat draws off the air;|And heat there's none| unless commixed with air:|For| since the nature of all heat is rare||Athrough it many seeds of air must move.|Thus nature of mind is triple; yet those all|Suffice not for creating sense- since mind|Accepteth not that aught of these can cause|Sense-bearing motions| and much less the thoughts|A man revolves in mind. So unto these|Must added be a somewhat| and a fourth;|That somewhat's altogether void of name;|Than which existeth naught more mobile| naught|More an impalpable| of elements|More small and smooth and round. That first transmits|Sense-bearing motions through the frame| for that|Is roused the first| composed of little shapes;|Thence heat and viewless force of wind take up|The motions| and thence air| and thence all things|Are put in motion; the blood is strook| and then|The vitals all begin to feel| and last|To bones and marrow the sensation comes-|Pleasure or torment. Nor will pain for naught|Enter so far| nor a sharp ill seep through||But all things be perturbed to that degree|That room for life will fail| and parts of soul|Will scatter through the body's every pore.|Yet as a rule| almost upon the skin|These motion aIl are stopped| and this is why|We have the power to retain our life.|Now in my eagerness to tell thee how|They are commixed| through what unions fit|They function so| my country's pauper-speech|Constrains me sadly. As I can| however||I'll touch some points and pass. In such a wise|Course these primordials 'mongst one another|With intermotions that no one can be|From other sundered| nor its agency|Perform| if once divided by a space;|Like many powers in one body they work.|As in the flesh of any creature still|Is odour and savour and a certain warmth||And yet from an of these one bulk of body|Is made complete| so| viewless force of wind|And warmth and air| commingled| do create|One nature| by that mobile energy|Assisted which from out itself to them|Imparts initial motion| whereby first|Sense-bearing motion along the vitals springs.|For lurks this essence far and deep and under||Nor in our body is aught more shut from view||And 'tis the very soul of all the soul.|And as within our members and whole frame|The energy of mind and power of soul|Is mixed and latent| since create it is|Of bodies small and few| so lurks this fourth||This essence void of name| composed of small||And seems the very soul of all the soul||And holds dominion o'er the body all.|And by like reason wind and air and heat|Must function so| commingled through the frame||And now the one subside and now another|In interchange of dominance| that thus|From all of them one nature be produced||Lest heat and wind apart| and air apart||Make sense to perish| by disseverment.|There is indeed in mind that heat it gets|When seething in rage| and flashes from the eyes|More swiftly fire; there is| again| that wind||Much| and so cold| companion of all dread||Which rouses the shudder in the shaken frame;|There is no less that state of air composed||Making the tranquil breast| the serene face.|But more of hot have they whose restive hearts||Whose minds of passion quickly seethe in rage-|Of which kind chief are fierce abounding lions||Who often with roaring burst the breast o'erwrought||Unable to hold the surging wrath within;|But the cold mind of stags has more of wind||And speedier through their inwards rouses up|The icy currents which make their members quake.|But more the oxen live by tranquil air||Nor e'er doth smoky torch of wrath applied||O'erspreading with shadows of a darkling murk||Rouse them too far; nor will they stiffen stark||Pierced through by icy javelins of fear;|But have their place half-way between the two-|Stags and fierce lions. Thus the race of men:|Though training make them equally refined||It leaves those pristine vestiges behind|Of each mind's nature. Nor may we suppose|Evil can e'er be rooted up so far|That one man's not more given to fits of wrath||Another's not more quickly touched by fear||A third not more long-suffering than he should.|And needs must differ in many things besides|The varied natures and resulting habits|Of humankind- of which not now can I|Expound the hidden causes| nor find names|Enough for all the divers shapes of those|Primordials whence this variation springs.|But this meseems I'm able to declare:|Those vestiges of natures left behind|Which reason cannot quite expel from us|Are still so slight that naught prevents a man|From living a life even worthy of the gods.|So then this soul is kept by all the body||Itself the body's guard| and source of weal;|For they with common roots cleave each to each||Nor can be torn asunder without death.|Not easy 'tis from lumps of frankincense|To tear their fragrance forth| without its nature|Perishing likewise: so| not easy 'tis|From all the body nature of mind and soul|To draw away| without the whole dissolved.|With seeds so intertwined even from birth||They're dowered conjointly with a partner-life;|No energy of body or mind| apart||Each of itself without the other's power||Can have sensation; but our sense| enkindled|Along the vitals| to flame is blown by both|With mutual motions. Besides the body alone|Is nor begot nor grows| nor after death|Seen to endure. For not as water at times|Gives off the alien heat| nor is thereby|Itself destroyed| but unimpaired remains-|Not thus| I say| can the deserted frame|Bear the dissevering of its joined soul||But| rent and ruined| moulders all away.|Thus the joint contact of the body and soul|Learns from their earliest age the vital motions||Even when still buried in the mother's womb;|So no dissevering can hap to them||Without their bane and ill. And thence mayst see|That| as conjoined is their source of weal||Conjoined also must their nature be.|If one| moreover| denies that body feel||And holds that soul| through all the body mixed||Takes on this motion which we title "sense"|He battles in vain indubitable facts:|For who'll explain what body's feeling is||Except by what the public fact itself|Has given and taught us? "But when soul is parted||Body's without all sense." True!- loses what|Was even in its life-time not its own;|And much beside it loses| when soul's driven|Forth from that life-time. Or| to say that eyes|Themselves can see no thing| but through the same|The mind looks forth| as out of opened doors||Is- a hard saying; since the feel in eyes|Says the reverse. For this itself draws on|And forces into the pupils of our eyes|Our consciousness. And note the case when often|We lack the power to see refulgent things||Because our eyes are hampered by their light-|With a mere doorway this would happen not;|For| since it is our very selves that see||No open portals undertake the toil.|Besides| if eyes of ours but act as doors||Methinks that| were our sight removed| the mind|Ought then still better to behold a thing-|When even the door-posts have been cleared away.|Herein in these affairs nowise take up|What honoured sage| Democritus| lays down-|That proposition| that primordials|Of body and mind| each super-posed on each||Vary alternately and interweave|The fabric of our members. For not only|Are the soul-elements smaller far than those|Which this our body and inward parts compose||But also are they in their number less||And scattered sparsely through our frame. And thus|This canst thou guarantee: soul's primal germs|Maintain between them intervals as large|At least as are the smallest bodies| which||When thrown against us| in our body rouse|Sense-bearing motions. Hence it comes that we|Sometimes don't feel alighting on our frames|The clinging dust| or chalk that settles soft;|Nor mists of night| nor spider's gossamer|We feel against us| when| upon our road||Its net entangles us| nor on our head|The dropping of its withered garmentings;|Nor bird-feathers| nor vegetable down||Flying about| so light they barely fall;|Nor feel the steps of every crawling thing||Nor each of all those footprints on our skin|Of midges and the like. To that degree|Must many primal germs be stirred in us|Ere once the seeds of soul that through our frame|Are intermingled 'gin to feel that those|Primordials of the body have been strook||And ere| in pounding with such gaps between||They clash| combine and leap apart in turn.|But mind is more the keeper of the gates||Hath more dominion over life than soul.|For without intellect and mind there's not|One part of soul can rest within our frame|Least part of time; companioning| it goes|With mind into the winds away| and leaves|The icy members in the cold of death.|But he whose mind and intellect abide|Himself abides in life. However much|The trunk be mangled| with the limbs lopped off||The soul withdrawn and taken from the limbs||Still lives the trunk and draws the vital air.|Even when deprived of all but all the soul||Yet will it linger on and cleave to life|-|Just as the power of vision still is strong||If but the pupil shall abide unharmed||Even when the eye around it's sorely rent-|Provided only thou destroyest not|Wholly the ball| but| cutting round the pupil||Leavest that pupil by itself behind-|For more would ruin sight. But if that centre||That tiny part of eye| be eaten through||Forthwith the vision fails and darkness comes||Though in all else the unblemished ball be clear.|'Tis by like compact that the soul and mind|Are each to other bound forevermore.,Lucretius by,nature

Sonnet Xvi: In Nature Apt ,In nature apt to like when I did see|Beauties| which were of many carats fine||My boiling sprites did thither soon incline||And| Love| I thought that I was full of thee:|But finding not those restless flames in me||Which others said did make their souls to pine||I thought those babes of some pin's hurt did whine||By my love judging what love's pain might be.|But while I thus with this young lion played||Mine eyes (shall I say curst or blest?) beheld|Stella; now she is nam'd| need more be said?|In her sight I a lesson new have spell'd||I now hav learn'd Love right| and learn'd even so||As who by being poisoned doth poison know.,Sidney Philip,nature
Leave Nature To Nature ,Have you ever seen the offspring of a cross between a sheep and goat|Of the parents in the young one you can see a bit of both|With the physical appearance of a goat and sheep strange as that may appear|Born of an act of Nature and in Nature of stranger things one does hear.|And anything in Nature is never a strange thing|A cross between a starling and a myna has a pleasant song to sing|But when humans tamper with Nature 'tis there the wrong comes in|Though some with their degrees on natural science respect for their work do win.|On what happens within Nature humans should not have a say|And leave Nature to Nature she does things her own way|Some results of Nature may seem quite strange to see|But what happens within Nature happens naturally.|Humans do not tamper with Nature leave Nature to her own device|Every time we tamper with her for to pay there is some price|The mad cow disease is one example when meat and bone to cows was fed|Just one of the many bad results of humans tampering with Nature one might say enough said.,Duggan Francis,nature

Sonnet Vii: When Nature ,When Nature made her chief work| Stella's eyes||In color black why wrapp'd she beams so bright?|Would she in beamy black| like painter wise||Frame daintiest lustre| mix'd of shades and light?|Or did she else that sober hue devise||In object best to knit and strength our sight||Lest if no veil those brave gleams did disguise||They sun-like should more dazzle than delight?|Or would she her miraculous power show||That whereas black seems Beauty's contrary||She even if black doth make all beauties flow?|Both so and thus| she minding Love shoud be|Placed ever there| gave him this mourning weed||To honor all their deaths| who for her bleed.,Sidney Philip,nature
Your Relationship With Nature ,Your relationship with Nature speaks volumes about you|Do you only see Nature as a means to financial gain or are you one of those who|Love Nature for her beauty and love her wildlife and her trees|And her rivers| lakes and mountains and her fields and flowers and bees?|Your relationship with Nature tells of the sort of person that you are|Do you see Nature's protectors as those who have gone too far|In their dispute with the developer in their fight for every tree|If this be so you support the environmental vandals or so 'twould seem to me?|Your relationship with Nature about you more can say|Than all of your friends and enemies can or so 'twould seem that way|For your apathy to Nature tells of your inner strife|And your attitude to Nature is your attitude to life.|Your relationship with Nature says far more about you|Than anyone else of you can say as their words may not be true|For if you love Mother Nature and with her live in harmony|Then you are working for the good of all of humanity.,Duggan Francis,nature
Nature ,When the morning sun rises in the sky|When the new day is born as beautiful|When the dew drops rolls down the leaves|When the garden of flowers hugs the nature|and shower its fragrance and makes nature proud|When the trees leaves oxygen for mankind|starts dancing to the tune of wind|When the birds sits on top of the trees and|singing to the nature's choir with happiness|When the fauna in the jungle sets free to live proudly|When the stream water gurgles from the mountain|and when wet earth makes barren land fertile|When the farmers glorify the nature with happiness|and start to cultivate food for the nations|When the sun sets behind the green mountains|and the moon start to light the nation|When the nature forgets its vastness|Then the God show his creation on his earth.,Sathasivam Ravi,nature

The Golden Gift That Nature Did Thee Give ,The golden gift that Nature did thee give|To fasten friends and feed them at thy will|With form and favour| taught me to believe|How thou art made to show her greatest skill||Whose hidden virtues are not so unknown|But lively dooms might gather at the first:|Where beauty so her perfect seed hath sown|Of other graces follow needs there must.|Now certes| lady| since all this is true||That from above thy gifts are thus elect||Do not deface them then with fancies new||Nor change of minds let not thy mind infect||But mercy him| thy friend| that doth thee serve||Who seeks alway thine honour to preserve.,Howard Henry,nature

My God Mother Nature ,I feel that I have heard enough of talk of World strife|And what I need is joy and love and peace back in my life|And I must refrain from listening to the radio news and watching T.V.|For rumours of revenge and war is worrying to me.|My God is of the female kind and she is dressed in green|And she is very beautiful the finest I have seen|And in these times of tension where the seed of hatred grow|I turn to Mother Nature the only God I know.|In the scrub patch across the way in the cool evening breeze|The honeyeaters and wattlebirds on the banksia trees|Are chirping and singing and at this time of year|The voices of the male birds all day long you hear.|The children of Mother Nature my God's family|In Nature's wild garden living wild and free|They live on the nectar of tree blossoms and flowers|And their worries are little when compared to ours.|On the news on the radio and the T.V.|These rumours of war seem all too much for me|So I turn to my God Mother Nature in moments like these|And in her green garden I find peace and ease.,Duggan Francis,nature
