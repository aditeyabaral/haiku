I doubt he knows\n \nwhat he means by \u201cenlightenment.\u201d I felt far away\nfrom my sister yesterday, when she called. Michael\n \ntalked to me of Christ\u2019s\ntenderness. I feel tender in this moment. Over\n \nand over I feel that words\ndo not represent me. I am not\n \nsure what that implies of my intentions\nin using them. Yesterday, Brenda and I saw\n \nthe Warhol show of the last ten years\nof his life. There seemed to have been hope\n \nto live meaningfully in capitalism then. ~~~~~~~ The waves\nof this beginning, the new life of my mind\n \nis settling. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve written. I\u2019ve decided\nto mark my continuing with the seven tildes above. And I added\n \na title tonight, Muerto Vecino, after Zizek\u2019s dubious interpretation\nof Kierkegaard\u2019s neighbor, and because of the funeral home\n \nacross the street. My thinking has changed, my being has changed,\nI am more alert and more engaged in thinking through the world.\n \nAnd I am able to speak better. I don\u2019t know what this means\nabout who I am. I try not to feel let down that for so much of my life\n \nI\u2019ve been restrained by psychotropic drugs. Before Zyprexa it was even\nworse, with up to 6 meds, as I\u2019ve said over and over to friends. I feel\n \nthe need to make clear what my obstacles have been. Not for pity,\na little for pride, but also for hope. If I can do that, then maybe I can help\n \nsomeone not suffer so much, like Brenda. I replaced the kitchen faucet\nthis past weekend. It makes me very happy that I was able to do it\n \nsuccessfully, without ever having been handy before in my life, and after\nspending most of my life disdainful of being practical in that way. What a joy\n \nto make Brenda so happy. I don\u2019t know how much longer I will live,\nand have often thought, recently, that it would be tragic if I died anytime\n \nsoon, but that it\u2019s imperative that I accept death when it arrives, after\naffirming life as fully as I can. It\u2019s too easy, and stupid, to be simplistically\n \noppositional. And to not know that people can ruin anything, but\nthat the substantial things have value of themselves, is foolish. I don\u2019t want to stop\n \nat my own ignorance and lack of forbearance. I don\u2019t believe in the West\non its own. As Michael says, the only thing that makes sense here\n \nis love. I have everything I could possibly ever want or need for now. More books\nwill come, more music too. And love is immeasurable\n \nwhen it\u2019s real. I am so grateful to have more waking time\non the weekends. I plan on making breakfast for Brenda\n \nevery Saturday and Sunday that I can\nfrom now on. Early. I see gardens in the future of our household.\n \nAnd I wonder about a Great Spirit. What does the name matter? I see the stones that live\nwithout water. I see the smoke that cleanses my vision, and a network of consciousness,\n \nwith each node another, on and on that way to the depths. My thinking will never\ngrasp it all\n \nbecause of that recursively created network of interior life. My thinking stops\nthen, barely able to contain the spherical and vast darkness\n \nfrom which all light arises. That\u2019s why what I see is dark. It is brilliant\nin its darkness. Like onyx and flint. I can only talk around what I\u2019ve seen\n \nthe past couple of weeks. It reframes, completely, the rest of my creative\nlife and the rest of my days. All I aim to do now is to focus my attention,\n \nso that I can see it all again in retrospect. So that I can read\nand gather more tools for understanding it. So that I understand myself,\n \nand something of the world, and love, and so that I help others. Geodon\nwill not erase it. I\u2019ve seen it already, many times. It is my natural state.\n \nI no longer see it as only hallucination. It is a way of being. A way that I can flesh\nout, here. Slowly. Carefully. And as I do, its destructive powers,\n \nwhich are massive and righteous, will subside. As it will know that it is being\ngiven to the world. Because it belongs to all. And all will be there soon.\n \nThere are signs already. Because to see it is to break, unless one knows something\nof love. It makes LSD\n \nsmall. It is God and the Universe as One.\nI am not the first to see it. But I am a person\n \ngiven a chance\nto write it, letter by letter, slowly, in terms of the light of my ignorance\n \nto see more fully\nwhat I do not know. I do not offer anything\n \nbut poems. But it breaks through\nmy mouth to arrive at the hearts of the world, at the hearts of the horses\n \nof the world, to allow us all to speak in silence. It is not God or the Universe.\nIt is One as All in you. Because I cannot see through myself\n \nwithout it. I see clearly\nthat the sun will not arrive\n \nin this new weather. But that the moon\nwill take its place. I see clearly that the sun is there\n \nto bring meaning to the sky, and that the earth is more full\nwith the light of the world\n \nextinguished for a brilliant view of wilderness. This is a view\nthat extends through opposites\n \nand arrives at a single body\nto witness this song. And this song is not the answer\n \nthat you believe in, because one day\nI will speak to you again\n \nin the rain\nand show you\n \nthat I do not know. Because knowledge\nbelongs to the earth. And the earth makes everything\n \nI know. And now that there is less and less freedom\nfrom coercion in a moneyed world, and now that Claire,\n \na friend, is moving on to be Christ in her own way, now\nthat Gu\u00e9non continues to call me to understand\n \nmy ignorance, to depart again\nfrom the friends at Kuna Yala, where I helped with the water,\n \nwith Brenda watching over me\nfrom a hammock between palms, now that Panam\u00e1\n \ncalls again to give me a union\nof the world, in more than two ways,\n \nand to distinguish from the surface of these times, I\nreceive\n \na call to awaken in the snow. I receive a call to acknowledge\nthat Geodon has planted itself\n \nwith capital\nin my consciousness, but that the world\n \nis stronger than to balance itself\nfrom the ozone and people alone. We are not erased, and we\n \ndo not control the earth. Geodon\nis an act of kindness, an agreement\n \nto live this life\nin a way that arrives\n \nwith the weather. It may continue\nfor the rest of my life, or it may not. I will not be afraid again\n \nto see things as I do, and I will not\nseek out the truth, intentionally, without some kind of agreement\n \nwith this custom. Because that is a way, for now,\nthat I speak. And it is useful, though better left\n \ninvisible. And the name, Geodon, brings trouble, I can see\nthrough it enough, with enough love in my life, to believe\n \nin the end of the reign of the Anti-Christ (not Obama). I need to learn again\nto be and to write. But to deliver\n \nwhat I saw\nI must return\n \nto the explosion of my inner life. To start with, otherwise and generally, I see\nonly outlines. Creation manifests\n \nfrom every direction, in an infinity\nof dimensions. Most of us\n \nspend most of our energy\nconscious of a very few of these dimensions. Imagine\n \nmore than the greatest works of art\nmanifesting endlessly\n \nfrom more directions than one can possibly count\nevery micro second, timelessly. It\u2019s glorious.\n \nAnd the only way to see it with any balance\nis impeccably, ethically, compassionately, and with at least an aim\n \ntoward the Divine. It IS the Divine. God and the Universe\nspoke to me. It is all, always, speaking to us. And what it says\n \nis endless\nit brings wholeness\n \nto the precious moment. It goes away\nwhen one tries to pin it down, as I do. I say less and less\n \nas I try to describe it. It is endlessly\ngenerative. It is good\n \nbut pitiless and merciful. It demands of us\nthat we arrive. And now that the thinking manifests\n \nin a way that allows\nfor union and a bridge, in a way that avoids\n \neasy condemnation, a thinking that reveals\nthe links toward light\n \nin motion, a primordial\nform of being\n \nin a new world that needs no one\nto believe in it, a vast chasm\n \nin what a bureaucracy of thought\ntries to pin us down with, the hole in time\n \nthat allows us to be free\nis here, we know it. All of us\n \ncan see through delusion. There is no road\nin the aftermath of earthquakes, no need for the time\n \nto extinguish the elements, no person\nlocked to your heart\n \nin the morning, no water to drink\nwithout thirst, no air is necessary to breathe\n \nunder the water of seeing, no\nneed for the earth to do anything\n \nother than revolve, in this\nnew light. Space\n \nundoes our links\nto the immovable. We deliver\n \nthe undone to the plains\nand see what the harvest\n \nwill fill with seed. The whole\ndoes not exist\n \nwithin outlines. All we can do\nis move to it. The music\n \nis unheard of\nin this world. It exists\n \nwithout origin. It is otherworldly,\nprimordial, and gentle. It vibrates,\n \nequally, in the Lamb, in\nthe Lotus, in\n \nthe stones\u2014there is no place\nunknown to it. It is\n \nmusic, and nothing more,\nand nothing less. It is that\n \neverywhere possible. It is harmonious\ninfinitely, and allows for any sound. To some\n \nit might seem like noise, but that\nis only the part. To achieve it\n \none need only listen. I cannot always\nhear it, but I have\n \nheard it. And now\nin my new mind, I listen for it\n \nundaunted and silent. I feel it filling\nmy body with love. Sometimes\n \nI have horrific thoughts. But I am learning\nthat these are but strong notes\n \nin the fullness\nof the music\n \nof my new mind. I can\u2019t always hear the song,\nbut I feel it now. It makes all context\n \nvast. I will receive it\nas long as it is here. I will not push\n \none way or the other with it. It is a fullness\nand does not want to be made\n \ninto a force. It is a force\nwithout me, and only to the degree\n \nto which this is true. No longer being able\nto receive it\n \nwill imply a failure\nof my imagination, of my ethics,\n \nand my spirit. There is no way\nto hold on to it. It serves\n \nno one. And it includes us all. To continue to receive it\nmore fully\n \nI grow. This implies\nthe world. It implies clarity. It implies\n \nmotion. But it rests motionlessly. If I have a softness in my voice\nit is caused by this music. When I don\u2019t\n \nI feel less. My voice can be loud\nto receive it, but this loudness\n \ncannot be yoked\nin outlines. There is nothing I can do.\n \nThere is nothing to expect. I can only\nlet it go. And I can only be afraid\n \nof the horror of my thoughts\nwithout this music. But now that I know\n \na taste of it, I have\nhope. Good people\n \nfeed it. I haven\u2019t always known\nwhat to do with it and others. But now\n \nI am a little less confused\nabout this. This is due\n \nto Buddhism, the little that I know\nof its practice. And to love. But it does not stop\n \nat my experience. I am ignorant\nand cannot offer knowledge. Except this\n \nmusic\ndoes not require knowledge. I\u2019m not sure\n \nwhat it requires. It requires\nto be received, but does not need us. Is there a pact\n \nbetween humanity\nand God? I don\u2019t know. Is there a God?\n \nI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not sure the question\nis enough on its own. Or maybe it is, if God\n \nis not limited by concept. And concept\nseems to be only a note in this song. Problems\n \nfeed it. \u201cLove\nis the absence of fear.\u201d And \u201clove\n \nbelieves all things,\nyet is never deceived.\u201d I aim\n \nto see through my delusions. I aim\nto be one of many, a small voice\n \nin the song of the world. I rest\nin silence\n \nas I always have. \u201cTo have a view\nas vast as the sky\n \nand as fine\nas a grain of sand.\u201d All beings\n \nwant to be loved\nand to be free\n \nfrom suffering. We strive\ndiligently\n \nto learn the vast expanse\nand the laser pointed focus\n \nof this gift. Remember that light\nmakes us. And that in this\n \nnew world, more and more\nis made of light. And if that is the case,\n \nwe move to move\nthe light of the world. Someday,\n \nperhaps, we will move\nthe light\n \nof the computer world. Only the compassionate\nand true\n \nwill be able to do so. Because only they\ncan be selfless enough\n \nto let it move through them. I am not there\nto move it\n \nbut I saw this. Long ago. Briefly. I was offered\na glimpse. It is utterly simple and beyond\n \nthought. There is hope. Intention\nis a thought. So one\n \nsees. I cannot tangle\nmyself\n \nin the line. But only to bridge. That is part of why\nit will all move. But I cannot wait\n \nuntil that is possible\nto become. I can wait\n \neternally and actively in the world\nto remain\n \nstill. With the calm and expansive\nlink\n \nthat allows us to live, so preciously\ntogether, I see through\n \nthe trouble that startles me, every moment\nand allow the seeing\n \nof my inner eye\nto burn through it. I do not remember\n \nwhat Zyprexa was like any longer. Except that it seems\nI have more to work with now, with my mind. And these\n \nwords are plain, so as to be careful in this new place. I see\nthat they do not break open my heart, as I read. And for that\n \nI relinquish this poem, and allow it to be only\na mark on the road to further inquiry. I allow it to see\n \nas I have made a vow to bridge, that my life\naims to be whole, even in the face of potential\n \ncatastrophes, I grow more and more\nto accept death as it arrives, to allow it to soften me,\n \nand to transform me as I have been transformed through Geodon, only\nto know that there is an isthmus, and that it is eternal. Only that there is one\n \nheart to allow myself to speak\nin the storms of tribulation, as one speaks\n \nto allow the teamwork of the fabric of need\nof the bird malingerer to see this\n \nin the aftermath of one who has died. Like a bicycle never once\ntogether enough to ride, I see this word here, again, to the removal\n \nof a people, to the homeland of union and pace, to the isthmus\nof a double link, one ocean to another, one continent\n \nto another, to the only union (even as it may be erased in my history), the place\nof one heart to allow the song to continue through conflict\n \nas she saw it then, one time, far away, when I hadn\u2019t known yet, that this\nwould be timeless. And there is one to it there to see it there, to allow\n \nit there to become and to see there as one is there to see\nand to allow one to arrive with it there and to see, and to be one with it\n \nthere as one is there to be with it. And to see there as one is there to believe\nas it is one to believe it there\n \nand to see it there as one with the soil and the air and the light and rain\nand to be there with one to be there one with it there once again, and to see it there\n \nand to believe as there is one there to believe it there again and to see. And to see\nthere as one is there to believe as it is there again\n \nand to see there as one is there to arrive and to be with it\nthere and to see it there once again and to see it there again\n \nand to believe as there is one to it again and to see and to hold\nand to see it there and to hold\n \nbeing that nothing holds\ndissolving\n written in transition from Zyprexa 10 mg/night to Geodon 160 mg/night\u2014December 23, 2009 (transition started), January 2, 2010 (poem started)"}, {"0": {"the news ejected minds": [2, 3, 9, 10]}, "1": {"eventual collapse sparks dream": [6, 7, 91, 95]}, "3": {"once move inhabitants": [67, 74, 76]}, "4": {"news collapse minds": [3, 7, 10]}, "6": {"news eventual collapse as a wind": [3, 6, 7, 54, 55, 57]}, "9": {"sea ocean the single dream as these": [79, 85, 88, 94, 95, 155, 156]}, "14": {"sea ocean the single dream as these": [79, 85, 88, 94, 95, 155, 156]}, "15": {"news collapse minds walking as a wind": [3, 7, 10, 13, 54, 55, 57]}, "poem": "waking to the news of an eventual collapse, those ejected minds\nof the walking thing of the speech of birds, they announce their own\ndevelopment from ashes to make a song and deliver the hunted\nlandscape to its stars, those of us who knew something of the engine\nwould remove the approach to animals as a second wind, the coming\nof pages of light and nectar, but once the arrival of her tent\nwould move the inhabitants of the Sea, and the consciousness of the Ocean\nto pursue the network that sparks their shining single dream\nto the pavement, the oceanic feet that would not muse its face or\ndeter those breaks from the second light of the morning, or one would\nsay the easy atonements that their push from the animal\nwould enlarge so that they would speak and we would understand,\nthese assembly code calypsos deter the kindly face that hates and pummels\nas these will undo their coloring and the fur of the path. do not stop\nuntil you know it well with both feet."}, {"0": {"this age reflects revolver": [5, 6, 20, 24]}, "1": {"right age reflects revolver": [3, 6, 20, 24]}, "2": {"reflects a body": [20, 28, 31]}, "3": {"far are foils": [36, 41, 67]}, "4": {"values age globes": [1, 6, 11]}, "5": {"reflects loon this place currents": [20, 90, 109, 110, 154]}, "6": {"values right age as the revolver": [1, 3, 6, 17, 18, 24]}, "7": {"reflects a body as an": [20, 28, 31, 128, 131]}, "8": {"reflects a body as loon blood": [20, 28, 31, 128, 163, 167]}, "9": {"sea moon a callused body as an": [14, 19, 28, 30, 31, 128, 131]}, "10": {"right age this place as an": [3, 6, 109, 110, 128, 131]}, "11": {"values age this attentive score as an": [1, 6, 109, 117, 118, 128, 131]}, "12": {"right age this place absorbs of the world": [3, 6, 109, 110, 134, 140, 141, 142]}, "13": {"your reflects can wake": [0, 20, 112, 130]}, "14": {"sea moon a callused body as an": [14, 19, 28, 30, 31, 128, 131]}, "15": {"values age globes live as a body": [1, 6, 11, 26, 27, 28, 31]}, "poem": "your values aren\u2019t right\nfor this age\nor memory\n \ncolor line. globes\nof the Sea\nsurvive revelation\n \nas the Moon reflects\nits own interior\nrevolver.

happened\nI oughta know man I was one of his army\nI mean man I was on his side\nHe made us feel all right\nWe were the first wave in the\nPostwar baby boom\nThe generation before had just come\nOut of the Great Depression and World War II\nYou know heavy vibes for people to wear\nSo much heaviness like some kind of\nVoiding of the emotions\n \nTheir music you know the songs\nLife always carries\nYou know every culture has songs\nWell anyway their music was\nRestrained emotion\nYou know like you didn\u2019t wanna dance\nIf you didn\u2019t know how\nWhich says something strange\nWell anyway Elvis came along\nAbout ten years after the nuke\nWhen the only generals America had in\nThe only army she had were Ike and Mac\nAnd stupor hung over the land\nA plague where everyone tried to\nMaterially free themselves\nStill too shell-shocked to understand\nTo feel what was happening\n \nEverything was getting hopeless\nThen when Elvis started to rock\nThe roll just picked up\nI mean drabness the beaver showed us\nCould only be a foretold future\nWho wanted to be Ward and June and\nI mean father never did know best\nHe was still crazy from surviving the war\n \nLike there was this psychotic pall\nSo widespread as to be assumed normal\nHeavy man     you know really\nAnyway Elvis showed us an out\nYou know he showed everyboyman and\nEverygirlwoman there\u2019s something good\nIn feeling good\nLike a prophet for everyboy everygirl\nWhen someones mom and dad lied\nSomething about him told us\nTo be sensual is really okay\nSomeones mom and dad waltzed us around\nEverygirl wasn\u2019t supposed to enjoy it\nIf she did she was bad and everyboy\nWell boys will be boys don\u2019t feel anything\nTake what you can\nMarry a decent girl when the fun\u2019s done\nLike no matter what we did we all were guilty\nMaybe someones mom and dad resented\nWhat they missed and while\nThey were trying to pass it on us\nWe heard Elvis\u2019s song and\nFor the first time we made up our own mind\n \nThe first wave rebelled\nI mean we danced even if we didn\u2019t know how\nI mean Elvis made us move\nInstead of standing mute he raised our voice\nAnd when we heard ourselves               something\nWas changing you know like for the first time\nWe made a collective decision about choices\n \nAmerica hurriedly made Pat Boone\nA general in the army they wanted us to join\nBut most of us held fast to Elvis\nAnd the commandants around him\nChuck Berry Buddy Holly Little Richard\nBo Diddley Gene Vincent     you know\nLike a different civil war all over again\n \nI mean you take don\u2019t be cruel\nI want you I need you I love you\nAnd jailhouse rock\nOr you take Pat and his white bucks\nSinging love letters in the sand\nHell man what\u2019s real here\nI mean Pat at the beach in his white bucks\nHis ears getting sunburned told us\nSomething about old wave delusion\nI mean wanting and needing and imprisonment\nWe all been to those places but what did\nWhite bucks at the beach understand\nOther than more straight line dancing\nYou know what I mean\n \nAnyway man for a while we had a breather\nFresh energy to keep us from falling into the big sleep\nThen before long Elvis got assassinated in all the fame\nTaking a long time to die       others seized\nControl while Elvis rode the needle out\nNever understanding what he\u2019d done\n \nIt\u2019s like we were the baby boom because\nLife needed a fresher start\nI mean two world wars in a row is\nReally crazy man\nAnd Elvis even though he didn\u2019t know he said it\nHe showed it to us anyway and even though\nWe didn\u2019t know we heard it        we heard it anyway\n \nMan like he woke us up\nAnd now they\u2019re trying to put us\nBack to sleep so we\u2019ll see how it goes\nAnyway look at the record man\nRock \u2019n\u2019 roll is based on revolution\nGoing way past 33 1/3\nYou gotta understand man he was\nAmerica\u2019s baby boom Che\nI oughta know man     I was in his army"}, {"0": {"the

The sun rose up;\nI stood alone 'mid thousands: but I felt\nMine inspiration; and, as the last sweep\nOf my song died away amid the hills,\nMy heart reverb'rated the shout which bore\nTo the blue mountains and the distant heavenErinna's name, and on my bended knee,\nOlympus, I received thy laurel crown.\n \n   And twice new birth of violets have sprung,\nSince they were first my pillow, since I sought\nIn the deep silence of the olive grove\nThe dreamy happiness which solitude\nBrings to the soul o'erfill'd with its delight:\nFor I was like some young and sudden heir\nOf a rich palace heap'd with gems and gold,\nWhose pleasure doubles as he sums his wealth\nAnd forms a thousand plans of festival;\nSuch were my myriad visions of delight.\nThe lute, which hitherto in Delphian shades\nHad been my twilight's solitary joy,\nWould henceforth be a sweet and breathing bond\nBetween me and my kind.    Orphan unloved,\nI had been lonely from my childhood's hour,\nChildhood whose very happiness is love:\nBut that was over now; my lyre would be\nMy own heart's true interpreter, and those\nTo whom my song was dear, would they not bless\nThe hand that waken'd it? I should be loved\nFor the so gentle sake of those soft chords\nWhich mingled others' feelings with mine own.\n \n    Vow'd I that song to meek and gentle thoughts,\nTo tales that told of sorrow and of love,\nTo all our nature's finest touches, all\nThat wakens sympathy: and I should be\nAlone no longer; every wind that bore,\nAnd every lip that breathed one strain of mine,\nHenceforth partake in all my joy and grief.\nOh! glorious is the gifted poet's lot,\nAnd touching more than glorious: 'tis to be\nCompanion of the heart's least earthly hour;\nThe voice of love and sadness, calling forth\nTears from their silent fountain: 'tis to have\nShare in all nature's loveliness; giving flowers\nA life as sweet, more lasting than their own;\nAnd catching from green wood and lofty pine\nLanguage mysterious as musical;\nMaking the thoughts, which else had only been\nLike colours on the morning's earliest hour,\nImmortal, and worth immortality;\nYielding the hero that eternal name\nFor which he fought; making the patriot's deed\nA stirring record for long after-time;\nCherishing tender thoughts, which else had pass'd\nAway like tears; and saving the loved dead\nFrom death's worst part \u2014 its deep forgetfulness.\n \nFrom the first moment when a falling leaf,\nOr opening bud, or streak of rose-touch'd sky,\nWaken'd in me the flush and flow of song,\nI gave my soul entire unto the gift\nI deem'd mine own, direct from heaven; it was\nThe hope, the bliss, the energy of life;\nI had no hope that dwelt not with my lyre,\nNo bliss whose being grew not from my lyre,\nNo energy undevoted to my lyre.\nIt was my other self that had a power;\nMine, but o'er which I had not a control.\nAt times it was not with me, and I felt\nA wonder how it ever had been mine:\nAnd then a word, a look of loveliness,\nA tone of music, call'd it into life;\nA song came gushing, like the natural tears,\nTo check whose current does not rest with us.\n \n    Had I lived ever in the savage woods,\nOr in some distant island, which the sea\nWith wind and wave guards in deep loneliness;\nHad my eye never on the beauty dwelt\nOf human face, and my ear never drank\nThe music of a human voice; I feel\nMy spirit would have pour'd itself in song,\nHave learn'd a language from the rustling leaves,\nThe singing of the birds, and of the tide.\nPerchance, then, happy had I never known\nAnother thought could be attach'd to song\nThan of its own delight.    Oh! let me pause\nOver this earlier period, when my heart\nMingled its being with its pleasures, fill'd\nWith rich enthusiasm, which once flung\nIts purple colouring o'er all things of earth,\nAnd without which our utmost power of thought\nBut sharpens arrows that will drink our blood.\nLike woman's soothing influence o'er man\nEnthusiasm is upon the mind;\nSoftening and beautifying that which is\nToo harsh and sullen in itself.    How much\nI loved the painter's glorious art, which forms\nA world like, but more beautiful than, this;\nJust catching nature in her happiest mood!\nHow drank I in fine poetry, which makes\nThe hearing passionate, fill'd with memories\nWhich steal from out the past like rays from clouds!\nAnd then the sweet songs of my native vale,\nWhose sweetness and whose softness call'd to mind\nThe perfume of the flowers, the purity\nOf the blue sky; oh, how they stirr'd my soul! \u2014\nAmid the many golden gifts which heaven\nHas left, like portions of its light, on earth\nNone hath such influence as music hath.\nThe painter's hues stand visible before us\nIn power and beauty; we can trace the thoughts\nWhich are the workings of the poet's mind:\nBut music is a mystery, and viewless\nEven when present, and is less man's act,\nAnd less within his order; for the hand\nThat can call forth the tones, yet cannot tell\nWhither they go, or if they live or die,\nWhen floated once beyond his feeble ear;\nAnd then, as if it were an unreal thing,\nThe wind will sweep from the neglected strings\nAs rich a swell as ever minstrel drew.\n \n    A poet's word, a painter's touch, will reach\nThe innermost recesses of the heart,\nMaking the pulses throb in unison\nWith joy or grief, which we can analyse;\nThere is the cause for pleasure and for pain:\nBut music moves us, and we know not why;\nWe feel the tears, but cannot trace their source.\nIs it the language of some other state,\nBorn of its memory?    For what can wake\nThe soul's strong instinct of another world,\nLike music?    Well with sadness doth it suit\nTo hear the melancholy sounds decay,\nAnd think (for thoughts are life's great human links,\nAnd mingle with our feelings) even so\nWill the heart's wildest pulses sink to rest.\n \n    How have I loved, when the red evening fill'd\nOur temple with its glory, first, to gaze\nOn the strange contrast of the crimson air,\nLighted as if with passion, and flung back,\nFrom silver vase and tripod rich with gems,\nTo the pale statues round, where human life\nWas not, but beauty was, which seem'd to have\nApart existence from humanity:\nThen, to go forth where the tall waving pines\nSeem'd as behind them roll'd a golden sea\nImmortal and eternal; and the boughs,\nThat darkly swept between me and its light,\nWere fitting emblems of the worldly cares\nThat are the boundary between us and heaven;\nMeanwhile, the wind, a wilful messenger\nLingering amid the flowers on his way,\nAt intervals swept past in melody,\nThe lutes and voices of the choral hymn\nContending with the rose-breath on his wing!\nPerhaps it is these pleasures' chiefest charm,\nThey are so indefinable, so vague.\nFrom earliest childhood all too well aware\nOf the uncertain nature of our joys,\nIt is delicious to enjoy, yet know\nNo after-consequence will be to weep.\nPride misers with enjoyment, when we have\nDelight in things that are but of the mind:\nBut half humility when we partake\nPleasures that are half wants, the spirit pines\nAnd struggles in its fetters, and disdains\nThe low base clay to which it is allied.\nBut here our rapture raises us: we feel\nWhat glorious power is given to man, and find\nOur nature's nobleness and attributes,\nWhose heaven is intellect; and we are proud\nTo think how we can love those things of earth\nWhich are least earthly; and the soul grows pure\nIn this high communing, and more divine.\n \n    This time of dreaming happiness pass'd by,\nAnother spirit was within my heart;\nI drank the maddening cup of praise, which grew\nHenceforth the fountain of my life; I lived\nOnly in others' breath; a word, a look,\nWere of all influence on my destiny:\nIf praise they spoke, 'twas sunlight to my soul;\nOr censure, it was like the scorpion's sting.\n \nAnd yet a darker lesson was to learn \u2014\nThe hollowness of each: that praise, which is\nBut base exchange of flattery; that blame,\nGiven by cautious coldness, which still deems\n'Tis safest to depress; that mockery,\nFlinging shafts but to show its own keen aim;\nThat carelessness, whose very censure's chance;\nAnd, worst of all, the earthly judgment pass'd\nBy minds whose native clay is unredeem'd\nBy aught of heaven, whose every thought falls foul\nPlague-spot on beauty which they cannot feel,\nTainting all that it touches with itself.\nO dream of fame, what hast thou been to me\nBut the destroyer of life's calm content!\nI feel so more than ever, that thy sway\nIs weaken'd over me. Once I could find\nA deep and dangerous delight in thee;\nBut that is gone.    I am too much awake.\nLight has burst o'er me, but not morning's light;\n'Tis such light as will burst upon the tomb,\nWhen all but judgment's over.    Can it be,\nThat these fine impulses, these lofty thoughts,\nBurning with their own beauty, are but given\nTo make me the low slave of vanity,\nHeartless and humbled?     O my own sweet power,\nSurely thy songs are made for more than this!\nWhat a worst waste of feeling and of life\nHave been the imprints of my roll of time,\nToo much, too long!    To what use have I turn'd\nThe golden gifts in which I pride myself?\nThey are profaned; with their pure ore I made\nA temple resting only on the breath\nOf heedless worshippers.    Alas! that ever\nPraise should have been what it has been to me \u2014\nThe opiate of my heart.    Yet I have dream'd\nOf things which cannot be; the bright, the pure,\nThat all of which the heart may only dream;\nAnd I have mused upon my gift of song,\nAnd deeply felt its beauty, and disdain'd\nThe pettiness of praise to which at times\nMy soul has bow'd; and I have scorn'd myself\nFor that my cheek could burn, my pulses beat\nAt idle words.    And yet it is in vain\nFor the full heart to press back every throb\nWholly upon itself.    Ay, fair as are\nThe visions of a poet's solitude,\nThere must be something more for happiness;\nThey seek communion.    It had seem'd to me\nA miser's selfishness, had I not sought\nTo share with others those impassion'd thoughts,\nLike light, or hope, or love, in their effects.\nWhen I have watch'd the stars write on the sky\nIn characters of light, have seen the moon\nCome like veiled priestess from the east,\nWhile, like a hymn, the wind swell'd on mine ear,\nTelling soft tidings of eve's thousand flowers,\nHas it not been the transport of my lute\nTo find its best delight in sympathy?\nAlas! the idols which our hopes set up,\nThey are Chaldean ones, half gold, half clay;\nWe trust we are deceived, we hope, we fear,\nAlike without foundation; day by day\nSome new illusion is destroyed, and life\nGets cold and colder on towards its close.\nJust like the years which make it, some are check'd\nBy sudden blights in spring; some are dried up\nBy fiery summers; others waste away\nIn calm monotony of quiet skies,\nAnd peradventure these may be the best:\nThey know no hurricanes, no floods that sweep\nAs a God's vengeance were upon each wave;\nBut then they have no ruby fruits, no flowers\nShining in purple, and no lighted mines\nOf gold and diamond.    Which is the best, \u2014\nBeauty and glory, in a southern clime,\nMingled with thunder, tempest; or the calm\nOf skies that scarcely change, which, at the least,\nIf much of shine they have not, have no storms?\nI know not: but I know fair earth or sky\nAre self-consuming in their loveliness,\nAnd the too radiant sun and fertile soil\nIn their luxuriance run themselves to waste,\nAnd the green valley and the silver stream\nBecome a sandy desert.    O! the mind,\nToo vivid in its lighted energies,\nMay read its fate in sunny Araby.\nHow lives its beauty in each Eastern tale,\nIts growth of spices, and its groves of balm!\nThey are exhausted; and what is it now?\nA wild and burning wilderness.    Alas!\nFor such similitude. Too much this is\nThe fate of this world's loveliest and best.\n \n    Is there not a far people, who possess\nMysterious oracles of olden time,\nWho say that this earth labours with a curse,\nThat it is fallen from its first estate,\nAnd is now but the shade of what it was?\nI do believe the tale.    I feel its truth\nIn my vain aspirations, in the dreams\nThat are revealings of another world,\nMore pure, more perfect than our weary one,\nWhere day is darkness to the starry soul.\n \n    O heart of mine! my once sweet paradise\nOf love and hope! how changed thou art to me!\nI cannot count thy changes: thou hast lost\nInterest in the once idols of thy being;\nThey have departed, even as if wings\nHad borne away their morning; they have left\nWeariness, turning pleasure into pain,\nAnd too sure knowledge of their hollowness.\n \n    And that too is gone from me; that which was\nMy solitude's delight!    I can no more\nMake real existence of a shadowy world.\nTime was, the poet's song, the ancient tale,\nWere to me fountains of deep happiness,\nFor they grew visible in my lonely hours,\nAs things in which I had a deed and part;\nTheir actual presence had not been more true:\nBut these are bubbling sparkles, that are found\nBut at the spring's first source.    Ah! years may bring\nThe mind to its perfection, but no more\nWill those young visions live in their own light;\nLife's troubles stir life's waters all too much,\nPassions chase fancies, and though still we dream,\nThe colouring is from reality.\n \n    Farewell, my lyre! thou hast not been to me\nAll I once hoped.    What is the gift of mind,\nBut as a barrier to so much that makes\nOur life endurable, \u2014 companionship,\nMingling affection, calm and gentle peace,\nTill the vex'd spirit seals with discontent\nA league of sorrow and of vanity,\nBuilt on a future which will never be!\n \n    And yet I would resign the praise that now\nMakes my cheek crimson, and my pulses beat,\nCould I but deem that when my hand is cold,\nAnd my lip passionless, my songs would be\nNumber'd mid the young poet's first delights;\nRead by the dark-eyed maiden in an hour\nOf moonlight, till her cheek shone with its tears;\nAnd murmur'd by the lover when his suit\nCalls upon poetry to breathe of love.\nI do not hope a sunshine burst of fame,\nMy lyre asks but a wreath of fragile flowers.\nI have told passionate tales of breaking hearts,\nOf young cheeks fading even before the rose;\nMy songs have been the mournful history\nOf woman's tenderness and woman's tears;\nI have touch'd but the spirit's gentlest chords, \u2014\nSurely the fittest for my maiden hand; \u2014\nAnd in their truth my immortality.\n \n    Thou lovely and lone star, whose silver light,\nLike music o'er the waters, steals along\nThe soften'd atmosphere; pale star, to thee\nI dedicate the lyre, whose influence\nI would have sink upon the heart like thine.\n \n    In such an hour as this, the bosom turns\nBack to its early feelings; man forgets\nHis stern ambition and his worldly cares,\nAnd woman loathes the petty vanities\nThat mar her nature's beauty; like the dew,\nShedding its sweetness o'er the sleeping flowers\nTill all their morning freshness is revived,\nKindly affections, sad but yet sweet thoughts,\nMelt the cold eyes, long, long unused to weep.\nO lute of mine, that I shall wake no more!\nSuch tearful music, linger on thy strings,\nConsecrate unto sorrow and to love;\nThy truth, thy tenderness, be all thy fame!"}, {"0": {"the starlet licks tongue": [11, 12, 49, 51]}, "1": {"volitional space licks tongue": [16, 19, 49, 51]}, "2": {"going this pity": [1, 142, 145]}, "3": {"then licks tongue": [35, 49, 51]}, "4": {"starlet thrashes thing": [12, 23, 26]}, "6": {"starlet sumptuous use as the door": [12, 137, 139, 149, 153, 155]}, "7": {"going this pity as the door": [1, 142, 145, 149, 153, 155]}, "8": {"going this pity as": [1, 142, 145, 149]}, "10": {"volitional space this pity as the door": [16, 19, 142, 145, 149, 153, 155]}, "11": {"starlet thrashes the sufficient tongue as a blankly": [12, 23, 25, 45, 51, 56, 57, 70]}, "12": {"volitional space this pity": [16, 19, 142, 145]}, "13": {"you have is required": [2, 3, 113, 114]}, "15": {"starlet thrashes thing licks of a sense": [12, 23, 26, 49, 63, 72, 74]}, "poem": "by going you have to be and\nseek it\nout\n \nsaid the starlet in the shared volitional language of space and time\nexplanation thrashes round the thing but doesn\u2019t touch it\nthe thing we know then as /style of thrashing/ or\nripples in the pond sufficient\nin itself, she licks her tongue, it could be desired as a figure\u2014\n \nfaithless as a class of examples\ni found new objects swimming blankly in a common\nsense, by going alone to listen\n                                                to them\n                         in the night\n            light of their pool\u2014\n \n                                     to begin with life or stars\n                                                              the spring as source or\n                                                      season\n                                         when to start\u2014i love what you\n                        said about the birds\n                        as distance is required for attraction\n                        & force keeps its distinctions\n                        in a tall hull\n                        called law\u2014\n                        clever in the style of depth in a painting\n                        sumptuous for use, and briefly this\n                        of fancy, pity, and devising,\n                        wherefore as it is at the right door\n                        make it language or rejoice\n                        this is how you touch me in my other ghosts\n                        & short of the occasion\n                        just a frequent mist of atoms\n                        all touching in the arms\n                        like an error in the wish"}, {"0": {"the one goes idea": [5, 6, 156, 158]}, "1": {"tired one goes idea": [2, 6, 156, 158]}, "2": {"get this point": [1, 32, 33]}, "3": {"so ask girls": [12, 15, 76]}, "4": {"one decisions care": [6, 11, 27]}, "7": {"get this point": [1, 32, 33]}, "8": {"get this point": [1, 32, 33]}, "9": {"next girl some harder girls from the soup": [34, 47, 55, 98, 108, 119, 120, 121]}, "10": {"tired one this point": [2, 6, 32, 33]}, "11": {"one decisions that harder girls from the soup": [6, 11, 24, 98, 108, 119, 120, 121]}, "12": {"tired one this point goes at the moment": [2, 6, 32, 33, 156, 160, 161, 162]}, "13": {"i get is checking": [0, 1, 197, 198]}, "14": {"next girl some harder girls from the soup girls": [34, 47, 55, 98, 108, 119, 120, 121, 131]}, "15": {"one decisions care goes at the moment": [6, 11, 27, 156, 160, 161, 162]}, "poem": "I get tired of being the one to make all the decisions so when they ask me where I want to eat, I say that I don\u2019t care, I\u2019d eat anything  \u2028at this point.

Whether it was damp and rainy or whether the sun shone and brought to life the floating dust that always hung in the workshop air. Maybe it was just a little poke in the eye.

From the concealed place where wine was stored. As in cellar. I find Braille contemplative. I touch my index finger to a bumpy piece of paper. My hand advances slowly left to right, the touch receptors in my finger triggered by the uneven contact of paper and skin. Messages run along nerves, finger-to-brain, brain-to-finger. Cognition sizzles. Mind notices this feels different than the pathway of sound in ear to auditory processing. Listening pulls me out into the world in an infinity of directions.

And less than two nights later we\u2019re all throwing our\nasses in a circle, cuttin\u2019 up, working up what was an effortless sweat,\nundeterred even as the music skipped on every hiccup of the fraying\nwires, tethered just as strenuously to joy as ever, like always, trying\nto catch a good breath, but I paid it no mind, no mind, no mind\u2014no,\nI wasn\u2019t absent upstairs exactly, I was hyper-present; what a ghost is\nto death I was to life, inside everything simultaneously\u2014the sub and\nthe synth, the blown-off roof and hole-stomped floor, the rise of\ntheir chests and the fall\u2014and only nigga returned me to this plane:my nigga, my nigga, a lyric left on my bottom lip like the sweet after-\nburn of Hennessy, but yo, it\u2019s like I was being called for, called out\nof need since I know that word only has such resonance in a world\nwhere we ain\u2019t free. And, nah, we ain\u2019t free, if you were wondering.\nThere are no shackles on me your eyes can see but none that I can\u2019t\nfeel as if they were appendages divided from me by the occurrence\nof civil war, a set of chimeless chains that could be yanked on and\nbring me, even at my most upright, to my knees. And if it happens\u2014\nagain\u2014I suppose I could pray, there, at my literally lowest moment,\nimmersed in the mess they\u2019ve made that I\u2019m tasked with cleaning\nup for the commendation of pennies. I hope I don\u2019t get shot while\ngenuflect since that\u2019s apparently a thing now in this country, but I\nworry such a selfish ask won\u2019t have sufficient fuel to reach heaven,\nthat the bastardized sparrow will burn up in the atmosphere as easily\nas tissue paper. And I recognize I\u2019m rambling now, but I\u2019m likewise\nincreasing my odds of bumping into the point of all this since inside\nthe milk of me something was stirred by what she said, but it\u2019s hard\nto translate a muscular language to a verbal one just as it\u2019s hard to\nrelate to folk who don\u2019t consider their own demise fifty \u2019leven times\na day at least, and for that relapse not to be an injurious ideation but\nan itch of practicality. What I wouldn\u2019t pay for the chance to not pay\nattention to every little thing\u2014how they talk near me and how they\ntalk when they believe I\u2019m nowhere near, what they do or don\u2019t do\nwith each other that they do or don\u2019t do with me, the questions they\nfeel quite content to ask me and the ones they never seem to though\nI leave the door open, the window, the bleeding heart. I know them\nso well, people who wouldn\u2019t know me from the next in the lineup;\nI know them so intimately you\u2019d think I love them all, and the gag is\nthat I do, by some undesired miracle, and that is part of all this, too.\nTo say they don\u2019t deserve my time is an obvious statement, but they\ntake it anyway because it\u2019s all they know, evident as I recount every\ntransgression taking seconds off my time on this earth, summing up\nto years, almost to the point I\u2019m gone already, in response to which\nI either swallow spit or spit out ellipses. Ask the wounded wall what\nI know of restraint, the manifesto I\u2019d pen with what pours out from\nmy punctured knuckles, though, perhaps, the poet was signaling that,\nall along, I\u2019ve been teaching the most important life lesson merely by\ndomesticating rage, confining it inside the margins of the flesh that\nmy parents made for me, the page my life is written against each day\nin corrective red ink. And this seems like the appropriate moment\nto divulge that her sermon came during a dialogue about poetic craft\nof all things, but if poetry can\u2019t be applied to how one moves through\nthis world then I see very little worth in it, which is where it started\nfor me. Poetry was a dead white thing in my life once, at the bottom\nof the trash can with the doll of Jesus they\u2019d tried pawning off on me\nback in Catholic school, but luckily I already knew one for us, by us,\nand thus found the inner-strength to soldier through the barren winter\nof lyrical delight rocking a pair of big-ass Timberlands and other on-\ntrend threads a person of greater gravitas could\u2019ve filled out better\naround the shoulders. But I digress\u2014since what I really mean to be\nspeaking on is how the Cavalier poets weren\u2019t really doing it for me\nduring high school, not because their explicit sexuality or their taste\nfor material excess and ambitious proximity to the throne were such\ndisagreeable subjects to me, at the time revisiting rap\u2019s mafioso era,\nbut because when we painted those same pictures as we preferred to,\nour tongues spiraling like ballerinas and bullets, they sought the ban\non sale or talked down on it as being absent of any artistic merit, as if\na nation\u2019s worth of people surviving subjugation is more science than\nart anyway, for if that were true, then we wouldn\u2019t have a culture and\nAmerica wouldn\u2019t have great product to push to the rest of the planet\naside from all the bombs it seems much keener on dropping casually\nlike Funkmaster Flex, and I\u2019d already grown tired in my young age,\nso tired, of trying to prove I\u2019m not stupid even above trying to prove\nI\u2019m smart. And those who doubt there\u2019s a difference have digging\nto do, deep into their pockets to get me what I\u2019m owed for damages,\nfor emotional distress and all things it\u2019s been made feasible to sue for\nwith solid legal representation. Funny, I once longed to be a lawyer,\nlittle fool that I was, my back against a brick wall painted by spotlight,\nrifles lined and aiming, in that night\u2019s vision\u2014legal fluency seemed\nthe only option for release from this burden because it\u2019s the language\nmy nemeses speak in. I do know bad English from black, but I know\npower even better because I\u2019ve brushed up against it just as a person\nin any number of neighborhoods around here may have brushed up\nagainst a police officer. Maybe it\u2019s needless to say I didn\u2019t go down\nan attorney path; I actually don\u2019t have a plan at all these days except\nevading the bullet and also the bullet points corporations thrive on,\nas if any of this is simple, as if I, symptom of systemic dysfunctions\nenveloped by skeleton and skin, am something simple. I\u2019d only ever\nbe two-dimensional if airbrushed on a blank T-shirt and even that\nwould show depth to someone\u2019s esteem for who I was with no one\nelse nearby, and all this means is that there is more to me or anyone\nalike than being menace or miscreant, minstrel or misanthrope, or\nmurdered as all four would be with equal fanfare. But what I really\nwant is to know what they feel when their black friend dies in that\ntypical way for it\u2019s maybe the only thing I don\u2019t know about them,\nwhile we practice poker faces and draft FAQs. Forget seeing eye to\neye for a second. Set aside the particular grammars of forgiveness\nwe use without pulling up the problem\u2019s root: do they still feel full\npeople if they put the hammer down? And when they can\u2019t answer,\nmake note that I can because I have those tools and also others that\nshall remain nameless in order to remain purposeful.

Each quietly \u201coracular,\u201d if in denial,\neach afraid of drought though remembering greened light in their plans,\ntheir reticulation, their watching the weather. To make a calm to spread\u2014there if we bother to look, to listen to the birds moving in and out, some staying.\nYou knew back gardens, and you knew the streets made bare, as they\nare here\u2014say, of Melbourne, green-gilled city, whose old planted trees become expendable?\nOr where I am, huge chunks of bush grubbed out daily with excuses made\nor not bothered with\u2014hard to keep track of outside the shade of verandas, offices.\nOr among the palms on another island, R\u00e9union, the warning of offensive odor\nthough a beauty that might make an activist or remaker of demi-lost verse forms.\nWhat is there in common, across the list of names, of species\u2014growing\nconditions, from a part of the world far from where they\u2019re coaxed into a differing\nlight?

That near and far line of prayer.\nOnce, on a very small island, a coral island big enough for a dozen palms\nand a colony of land crabs and two humans, the heart of a young palm\nwas torn out and handed over to the one unfamiliar with its form or taste.\nHe ate, and the palm was gone.

I knew a couple who screened their cedar kit home\nfrom a country pub with a line then another line and another line of native trees.\nI have a family who planted tens of thousands of trees to reclaim saltland settlement\nhauled out of its deep sleeping, its subroots. I knew a person who filled empty\npaddocks with trees deleted for a new suburb, next to the new suburb where\nbushland had hung on against the trend, gone late. To have known morning in those places!\nI know you\u2019ll have known this\u2014how thick vegetation, the uprights and bends\nof trees on a still morning, can enhance our ability to pick out the between-notes\nof birdwork. You wrote of clarity, and translated ornate forms, to be filled with a moment\u2019s\nsingularity. Respiration. Our greatest breath might be so low or a rasp like a storm\ncoming in to rejuvenate, to depart with cataclysm. And so we pass with varying\ndegrees of light, the need for oxygen in the dismantling of carbohydrates.\nNight is eating of oxygen. But more, much more out in bare day. So in our sleep\nwe join the trees, wrapped in leaves and fronds, held out of consciousness by tendrils.\nSo we thank god for photosynthesis more than we thank god for the sun as itself?\nHere, we have valley, we have curved rim of valley closing out, here we have a kite, too\u2014\na black-shouldered kite that hovers above the infrequent powerlines and self-supply,\nand here we have year building on year that is an aside to a past that builds in all directions.\nThe inner green of room cracked in the thermal economics of presence\nthat underwrites reflection in crops and their residues, a shattering of light\nin glassy stubble, the march against concrete and lead, against ordnance\nand conquest, just roots holding soil so dry it is tempted to lift as a plume\nacross the district, hungering after the great dust devil that took off a roof\nand opened a house down near Picnic Hill Road not long after you passed.\nInterior of wood of fallen branch of loosened fibers and machines striking out\nfrom gravel shoulders to lay great flooded gums on creek beds a trickle of old seasons\ngreen with algae, green with signatures of flow, the bridges where great roots held sway.\nWhat remakes such wasted soil? We try local species and intertwine with olive trees.\nAnd in our suppressed thoughts, palmistry is a lush future of shade and flycatchers\nmaintaining the relationship between mosquitoes and moisture. No toxins; no anti-growth.\nOur night-lights out here stick out sharp\u2014sore thumb exposure, a failure of perspective\nof what is lured to the hot light. Mouth dry.

This stuff we do with our souls to adjust\nthe fragments of bush to whose maps? To miss the kangaroo trail though it\u2019s before our eyes,\nor the path of an elusive rain, or a lake whose existence you might request, hint at, question?\nDiverse as the air after war is gone but we still can\u2019t breathe so something slips\nor grafts.

my water-trough\nOn a hot, hot day, and I in pyjamas for the heat,\nTo drink there.\n \nIn the deep, strange-scented shade of the great dark carob tree\nI came down the steps with my pitcher\nAnd must wait, must stand and wait, for there he was at the trough\n            before me.\n \nHe reached down from a fissure in the earth-wall in the gloom\nAnd trailed his yellow-brown slackness soft-bellied down, over\n            the edge of the stone trough\nAnd rested his throat upon the stone bottom,\nAnd where the water had dripped from the tap, in a small clearness,\nHe sipped with his straight mouth,\nSoftly drank through his straight gums, into his slack long body,\nSilently.\n \nSomeone was before me at my water-trough,\nAnd I, like a second-comer, waiting.\n \nHe lifted his head from his drinking, as cattle do,\nAnd looked at me vaguely, as drinking cattle do,\nAnd flickered his two-forked tongue from his lips, and mused\n             a moment,\nAnd stooped and drank a little more,\nBeing earth-brown, earth-golden from the burning bowels\n            of the earth\nOn the day of Sicilian July, with Etna smoking.\n \nThe voice of my education said to me\nHe must be killed,\nFor in Sicily the black, black snakes are innocent, the gold\n            are venomous.\n \nAnd voices in me said, If you were a man\nYou would take a stick and break him now, and finish him off.\n \nBut must I confess how I liked him,\nHow glad I was he had come like a guest in quiet, to drink\n            at my water-trough\nAnd depart peaceful, pacified, and thankless,\nInto the burning bowels of this earth?\n \nWas it cowardice, that I dared not kill him?\nWas it perversity, that I longed to talk to him?\nWas it humility, to feel so honoured?\nI felt so honoured.\n \nAnd yet those voices:If you were not afraid, you would kill him!\n \nAnd truly I was afraid, I was most afraid,\nBut even so, honoured still more\nThat he should seek my hospitality\nFrom out the dark door of the secret earth.\n \nHe drank enough\nAnd lifted his head, dreamily, as one who has drunken,\nAnd flickered his tongue like a forked night on the air, so black,\nSeeming to lick his lips,\nAnd looked around like a god, unseeing, into the air,\nAnd slowly turned his head,\nAnd slowly, very slowly, as if thrice adream,\nProceeded to draw his slow length curving round\nAnd climb again the broken bank of my wall-face.\n \nAnd as he put his head into that dreadful hole,\nAnd as he slowly drew up, snake-easing his shoulders,\n            and entered farther,\nA sort of horror, a sort of protest against his withdrawing into\n            that horrid black hole,\nDeliberately going into the blackness, and slowly drawing\n            himself after,\nOvercame me now his back was turned.\n \nI looked round, I put down my pitcher,\nI picked up a clumsy log\nAnd threw it at the water-trough with a clatter.\n \nI think it did not hit him,\nBut suddenly that part of him that was left behind convulsed\n            in an undignified haste,\nWrithed like lightning, and was gone\nInto the black hole, the earth-lipped fissure in the wall-front,\nAt which, in the intense still noon, I stared with fascination.\n \nAnd immediately I regretted it.\nI thought how paltry, how vulgar, what a mean act!\nI despised myself and the voices of my accursed human education.\n \nAnd I thought of the albatross,\nAnd I wished he would come back, my snake.\n \nFor he seemed to me again like a king,\nLike a king in exile, uncrowned in the underworld,\nNow due to be crowned again.\n \nAnd so, I missed my chance with one of the lords\nOf life.\nAnd I have something to expiate:\nA pettiness.\n \n

Even as he is for your growth\nso is he for your pruning.\n     Even as he ascends to your height and\ncaresses your tenderest branches that quiver\nin the sun,\n     So shall he descend to your roots and\nshake them in their clinging to the earth.\n                                       \u2022\n     Like sheaves of corn he gathers you unto\nhimself.\n     He threshes you to make you naked.\n     He sifts you to free you from your husks.\n     He grinds you to whiteness.\n     He kneads you until you are pliant;\n     And then he assigns you to his sacred\nfire, that you may become sacred bread for\nGod\u2019s sacred feast.\n \n     All these things shall love do unto you\nthat you may know the secrets of your\nheart, and in that knowledge become a\nfragment of Life\u2019s heart.\n \n     But if in your fear you would seek only\nlove\u2019s peace and love\u2019s pleasure,\n     Then it is better for you that you cover\nyour nakedness and pass out of love\u2019s\nthreshing-floor,\n     Into the seasonless world where you\nshall laugh, but not all of your laughter,\nand weep, but not all of your tears.\n                                      \u2022\n     Love gives naught but itself and takes\nnaught but from itself.\n     Love possesses not nor would it be\npossessed;\n     For love is sufficient unto love.\n \n     When you love you should not say,\n\u201cGod is in my heart,\u201d but rather, \u201cI am\nin the heart of God.\u201d\n     And think not you can direct the course\nof love, for love, if it finds you worthy,\ndirects your course.\n \n     Love has no other desire but to fulfil\nitself.\n     But if you love and must needs have\ndesires, let these be your desires:\n     To melt and be like a running brook\nthat sings its melody to the night.\n     To know the pain of too much tenderness.\n     To be wounded by your own under-\nstanding of love;\n     And to bleed willingly and joyfully.\n     To wake at dawn with a winged heart\nand give thanks for another day of loving;\n     To rest at the noon hour and meditate\nlove\u2019s ecstasy;\n     To return home at eventide with grati-\ntude;\n     And then to sleep with a prayer for the\nbeloved in your heart and a song of praise\nupon your lips."}, {"0": {"the days pumped arms": [1, 2, 12, 13]}, "4": {"days prune arms": [2, 5, 13]}, "5": {"pumped douglass all singers liberation": [12, 64,

lay,\nGround by the weight to heat, not knowing then\nThe air, the light, the noise, the world of men.\n \n                                  THE TREES\nWe grew on mountains where the glaciers cry,\nInfinite sombre armies of us stood\nBelow the snow-peaks which defy the sky;\nA song like the gods moaning filled our wood;\nWe knew no men\u2014our life was to stand staunch,\nSinging our song, against the avalanche.\n \n                         THE HEMP AND FLAX\n \nWe were a million grasses on the hill,\nA million herbs which bowed as the wind blew,\nTrembling in every fibre, never still;\nOut of the summer earth sweet life we drew.\nLittle blue-flowered grasses up the glen,\nGlad of the sun, what did we know of men?\n \n                               THE WORKERS\n \nWe tore the iron from the mountain\u2019s hold,\nBy blasting fires we smithied it to steel;\nOut of the shapeless stone we learned to mould\nThe sweeping bow, the rectilinear keel;\nWe hewed the pine to plank, we split the fir,\nWe pulled the myriad flax to fashion her.\n \nOut of a million lives our knowledge came,\nA million subtle craftsmen forged the means;\nSteam was our handmaid and our servant flame,\nWater our strength, all bowed to our machines.\nOut of the rock, the tree, the springing herb\nWe built this wandering beauty so superb.\n  \n                                 THE SAILORS\n \nWe, who were born on earth and live by air,\nMake this thing pass across the fatal floor,\nThe speechless sea; alone we commune there\nJesting with death, that ever open door.\nSun, moon and stars are signs by which we drive\nThis wind-blown iron like a thing alive.\n \n                                      THE SHIP\n \nI march across great waters like a queen,\nI whom so many wisdoms helped to make;\nOver the uncruddled billows of seas green\nI blanch the bubbled highway of my wake.\nBy me my wandering tenants clasp the hands,\nAnd know the thoughts of men in other lands."}, {"0": {"a boy

 all this the builder caused.\nAnd standing there, it seemed that all the hive\n     Of human skill which now it had become,\nWas stone no more, nor building, but alive,\n     Trying to speak, this tower that was dumb,\n Trying to speak, nay, speaking, soul to soul\nWith powers who are, to raven or control"}, {"0": {"the urge helps beauty": [4, 6, 27, 54]}, "1": {"useless urge helps beauty": [5, 6, 27, 54]}, "3": {"just say happiness": [22, 24, 37]}, "4": {"part happiness beauty": [0, 37, 54]}, "6": {"part useless urge": [0, 5, 6]}, "9": {"firstorder turgenev the tyrannical mother": [44, 69, 75, 86, 87]}, "11": {"part happiness the right reasons for a quality": [0, 37, 41, 42, 43, 53, 64, 66]}, "13": {"there say is suffering": [12, 18, 38, 39]}, "14": {"firstorder turgenev the tyrannical mother": [44, 69, 75, 86, 87]}, "15": {"part happiness beauty makes of the point": [0, 37, 54, 127, 140, 141, 142]}, "poem": "Part of suffering is the useless urge to announce that you\u2019re suffering.\n \nThere is no other way to say it: I\u2019m suffering.

Crispin,\nThe lutanist of fleas, the knave, the thane,\nThe ribboned stick, the bellowing breeches, cloak\nOf China, cap of Spain, imperative haw\nOf hum, inquisitorial botanist,\nAnd general lexicographer of mute\nAnd maidenly greenhorns, now beheld himself,\nA skinny sailor peering in the sea-glass.\nWhat word split up in clickering syllables\nAnd storming under multitudinous tones\nWas name for this short-shanks in all that brunt?\nCrispin was washed away by magnitude.\nThe whole of life that still remained in him\nDwindled to one sound strumming in his ear,\nUbiquitous concussion, slap and sigh,\nPolyphony beyond his baton's thrust.\nCould Crispin stem verboseness in the sea,\nThe old age of a watery realist,\nTriton, dissolved in shifting diaphanes\nOf blue and green? A wordy, watery age\nThat whispered to the sun's compassion, made\nA convocation, nightly, of the sea-stars,\nAnd on the cropping foot-ways of the moon\nLay grovelling. Triton incomplicate with that\nWhich made him Triton, nothing left of him,\nExcept in faint, memorial gesturings,\nThat were like arms and shoulders in the waves,\nHere, something in the rise and fall of wind\nThat seemed hallucinating horn, and here,\nA sunken voice, both of remembering\nAnd of forgetfulness, in alternate strain.\nJust so an ancient Crispin was dissolved.\nThe valet in the tempest was annulled.\nBordeaux to Yucatan, Havana next,\nAnd then to Carolina. Simple jaunt.\nCrispin, merest minuscule in the gates,\nDejected his manner to the turbulence.\nThe salt hung on his spirit like a frost,\nThe dead brine melted in him like a dew\nOf winter, until nothing of himself\nRemained, except some starker, barer self\nIn a starker, barer world, in which the sun\nWas not the sun because it never shone\nWith bland complaisance on pale parasols,\nBeetled, in chapels, on the chaste bouquets.\nAgainst his pipping sounds a trumpet cried\nCelestial sneering boisterously. Crispin\nBecame an introspective voyager.\nHere was the veritable ding an sich, at last,\nCrispin confronting it, a vocable thing,\nBut with a speech belched out of hoary darks\nNoway resembling his, a visible thing,\nAnd excepting negligible Triton, free\nFrom the unavoidable shadow of himself\nThat lay elsewhere around him. Severance\nWas clear. The last distortion of romance\nForsook the insatiable egotist. The sea\nSevers not only lands but also selves.\nHere was no help before reality.\nCrispin beheld and Crispin was made new.\nThe imagination, here, could not evade,\nIn poems of plums, the strict austerity\nOf one vast, subjugating, final tone.\nThe drenching of stale lives no more fell down.\nWhat was this gaudy, gusty panoply?\nOut of what swift destruction did it spring?\nIt was caparison of mind and cloud\nAnd something given to make whole among\nThe ruses that were shattered by the large.\n \n                                 iiConcerning the Thunderstorms of Yucatan\nIn Yucatan, the Maya sonneteers\nOf the Caribbean amphitheatre,\nIn spite of hawk and falcon, green toucan\nAnd jay, still to the night-bird made their plea,\nAs if raspberry tanagers in palms,\nHigh up in orange air, were barbarous.\nBut Crispin was too destitute to find\nIn any commonplace the sought-for aid.\nHe was a man made vivid by the sea,\nA man come out of luminous traversing,\nMuch trumpeted, made desperately clear,\nFresh from discoveries of tidal skies,\nTo whom oracular rockings gave no rest.\nInto a savage color he went on.\nHow greatly had he grown in his demesne,\nThis auditor of insects! He that saw\nThe stride of vanishing autumn in a park\nBy way of decorous melancholy; he\nThat wrote his couplet yearly to the spring,\nAs dissertation of profound delight,\nStopping, on voyage, in a land of snakes,\nFound his vicissitudes had much enlarged\nHis apprehension, made him intricate\nIn moody rucks, and difficult and strange\nIn all desires, his destitution's mark.\nHe was in this as other freemen are,\nSonorous nutshells rattling inwardly.\nHis violence was for aggrandizement\nAnd not for stupor, such as music makes\nFor sleepers halfway waking. He perceived\nThat coolness for his heat came suddenly,\nAnd only, in the fables that he scrawled\nWith his own quill, in its indigenous dew,\nOf an aesthetic tough, diverse, untamed,\nIncredible to prudes, the mint of dirt,\nGreen barbarism turning paradigm.\nCrispin foresaw a curious promenade\nOr, nobler, sensed an elemental fate,\nAnd elemental potencies and pangs,\nAnd beautiful barenesses as yet unseen,\nMaking the most of savagery of palms,\nOf moonlight on the thick, cadaverous bloom\nThat yuccas breed, and of the panther's tread.\nThe fabulous and its intrinsic verse\nCame like two spirits parlaying, adorned\nIn radiance from the Atlantic coign,\nFor Crispin and his quill to catechize.\nBut they came parlaying of such an earth,\nSo thick with sides and jagged lops of green,\nSo intertwined with serpent-kin encoiled\nAmong the purple tufts, the scarlet crowns,\nScenting the jungle in their refuges,\nSo streaked with yellow, blue and green and red\nIn beak and bud and fruity gobbet-skins,\nThat earth was like a jostling festival\nOf seeds grown fat, too juicily opulent,\nExpanding in the gold's maternal warmth.\nSo much for that. The affectionate emigrant found\nA new reality in parrot-squawks.\nYet let that trifle pass. Now, as this odd\nDiscoverer walked through the harbor streets\nInspecting the cabildo, the fa\u00e7ade\nOf the cathedral, making notes, he heard\nA rumbling, west of Mexico, it seemed,\nApproaching like a gasconade of drums.\nThe white cabildo darkened, the fa\u00e7ade,\nAs sullen as the sky, was swallowed up\nIn swift, successive shadows, dolefully.\nThe rumbling broadened as it fell. The wind,\nTempestuous clarion, with heavy cry,\nCame bluntly thundering, more terrible\nThan the revenge of music on bassoons.\nGesticulating lightning, mystical,\nMade pallid flitter. Crispin, here, took flight.\nAn annotator has his scruples, too.\nHe knelt in the cathedral with the rest,\nThis connoisseur of elemental fate,\nAware of exquisite thought. The storm was one\nOf many proclamations of the kind,\nProclaiming something harsher than he learned\nFrom hearing signboards whimper in cold nights\nOr seeing the midsummer artifice\nOf heat upon his pane. This was the span\nOf force, the quintessential fact, the note\nOf Vulcan, that a valet seeks to own,\nThe thing that makes him envious in phrase.\nAnd while the torrent on the roof still droned\nHe felt the Andean breath. His mind was free\nAnd more than free, elate, intent, profound\nAnd studious of a self possessing him,\nThat was not in him in the crusty town\nFrom which he sailed. Beyond him, westward, lay\nThe mountainous ridges, purple balustrades,\nIn which the thunder, lapsing in its clap,\nLet down gigantic quavers of its voice,\nFor Crispin to vociferate again.                                iii                 Approaching Carolina\nThe book of moonlight is not written yet\nNor half begun, but, when it is, leave room\nFor Crispin, fagot in the lunar fire,\nWho, in the hubbub of his pilgrimage\nThrough sweating changes, never could forget\nThat wakefulness or meditating sleep,\nIn which the sulky strophes willingly\nBore up, in time, the somnolent, deep songs.\nLeave room, therefore, in that unwritten book\nFor the legendary moonlight that once burned\nIn Crispin's mind above a continent.\nAmerica was always north to him,\nA northern west or western north, but north,\nAnd thereby polar, polar-purple, chilled\nAnd lank, rising and slumping from a sea\nOf hardy foam, receding flatly, spread\nIn endless ledges, glittering, submerged\nAnd cold in a boreal mistiness of the moon.\nThe spring came there in clinking pannicles\nOf half-dissolving frost, the summer came,\nIf ever, whisked and wet, not ripening,\nBefore the winter's vacancy returned.\nThe myrtle, if the myrtle ever bloomed,\nWas like a glacial pink upon the air.\nThe green palmettoes in crepuscular ice\nClipped frigidly blue-black meridians,\nMorose chiaroscuro, gauntly drawn.\nHow many poems he denied himself\nIn his observant progress, lesser things\nThan the relentless contact he desired;\nHow many sea-masks he ignored; what sounds\nHe shut out from his tempering ear; what thoughts,\nLike jades affecting the sequestered bride;\nAnd what descants, he sent to banishment!\nPerhaps the Arctic moonlight really gave\nThe liaison, the blissful liaison,\nBetween himself and his environment,\nWhich was, and is, chief motive, first delight,\nFor him, and not for him alone. It seemed\nElusive, faint, more mist than moon, perverse,\nWrong as a divagation to Peking,\nTo him that postulated as his theme\nThe vulgar, as his theme and hymn and flight,\nA passionately niggling nightingale.\nMoonlight was an evasion, or, if not,\nA minor meeting, facile, delicate.\nThus he conceived his voyaging to be\nAn up and down between two elements,\nA fluctuating between sun and moon,\nA sally into gold and crimson forms,\nAs on this voyage, out of goblinry,\nAnd then retirement like a turning back\nAnd sinking down to the indulgences\nThat in the moonlight have their habitude.\nBut let these backward lapses, if they would,\nGrind their seductions on him, Crispin knew\nIt was a flourishing tropic he required\nFor his refreshment, an abundant zone,\nPrickly and obdurate, dense, harmonious\nYet with a harmony not rarefied\nNor fined for the inhibited instruments\nOf over-civil stops. And thus he tossed\nBetween a Carolina of old time,\nA little juvenile, an ancient whim,\nAnd the visible, circumspect presentment drawn\nFrom what he saw across his vessel's prow.\nHe came. The poetic hero without palms\nOr jugglery, without regalia.\nAnd as he came he saw that it was spring,\nA time abhorrent to the nihilist\nOr searcher for the fecund minimum.\nThe moonlight fiction disappeared. The spring,\nAlthough contending featly in its veils,\nIrised in dew and early fragrancies,\nWas gemmy marionette to him that sought\nA sinewy nakedness. A river bore\nThe vessel inward. Tilting up his nose,\nHe inhaled the rancid rosin, burly smells\nOf dampened lumber, emanations blown\nFrom warehouse doors, the gustiness of ropes,\nDecays of sacks, and all the arrant stinks\nThat helped him round his rude aesthetic out.\nHe savored rankness like a sensualist.\nHe marked the marshy ground around the dock,\nThe crawling railroad spur, the rotten fence,\nCurriculum for the marvellous sophomore.\nIt purified. It made him see how much\nOf what he saw he never saw at all.\nHe gripped more closely the essential prose\nAs being, in a world so falsified,\nThe one integrity for him, the one\nDiscovery still possible to make,\nTo which all poems were incident, unless\nThat prose should wear a poem's guise at last.                             iv               The Idea of a Colony\nNota: his soil is man's intelligence.\nThat's better. That's worth crossing seas to find.\nCrispin in one laconic phrase laid bare\nHis cloudy drift and planned a colony.\nExit the mental moonlight, exit lex,\nRex and principium, exit the whole\nShebang. Exeunt omnes. Here was prose\nMore exquisite than any tumbling verse:\nA still new continent in which to dwell.\nWhat was the purpose of his pilgrimage,\nWhatever shape it took in Crispin's mind,\nIf not, when all is said, to drive away\nThe shadow of his fellows from the skies,\nAnd, from their stale intelligence released,\nTo make a new intelligence prevail?\nHence the reverberations in the words\nOf his first central hymns, the celebrants\nOf rankest trivia, tests of the strength\nOf his aesthetic, his philosophy,\nThe more invidious, the more desired.\nThe florist asking aid from cabbages,\nThe rich man going bare, the paladin\nAfraid, the blind man as astronomer,\nThe appointed power unwielded from disdain.\nHis western voyage ended and began.\nThe torment of fastidious thought grew slack,\nAnother, still more bellicose, came on.\nHe, therefore, wrote his prolegomena,\nAnd, being full of the caprice, inscribed\nCommingled souvenirs and prophecies.\nHe made a singular collation. Thus:\nThe natives of the rain are rainy men.\nAlthough they paint effulgent, azure lakes,\nAnd April hillsides wooded white and pink,\nTheir azure has a cloudy edge, their white\nAnd pink, the water bright that dogwood bears.\nAnd in their music showering sounds intone.\nOn what strange froth does the gross Indian dote,\nWhat Eden sapling gum, what honeyed gore,\nWhat pulpy dram distilled of innocence,\nThat streaking gold should speak in him\nOr bask within his images and words?\nIf these rude instances impeach themselves\nBy force of rudeness, let the principle\nBe plain. For application Crispin strove,\nAbhorring Turk as Esquimau, the lute\nAs the marimba, the magnolia as rose.\nUpon these premises propounding, he\nProjected a colony that should extend\nTo the dusk of a whistling south below the south.\nA comprehensive island hemisphere.\nThe man in Georgia waking among pines\nShould be pine-spokesman. The responsive man,\nPlanting his pristine cores in Florida,\nShould prick thereof, not on the psaltery,\nBut on the banjo's categorical gut,\nTuck tuck, while the flamingos flapped his bays.\nSepulchral se\u00f1ors, bibbing pale mescal,\nOblivious to the Aztec almanacs,\nShould make the intricate Sierra scan.\nAnd dark Brazilians in their caf\u00e9s,\nMusing immaculate, pampean dits,\nShould scrawl a vigilant anthology,\nTo be their latest, lucent paramour.\nThese are the broadest instances. Crispin,\nProgenitor of such extensive scope,\nWas not indifferent to smart detail.\nThe melon should have apposite ritual,\nPerformed in verd apparel, and the peach,\nWhen its black branches came to bud, belle day,\nShould have an incantation. And again,\nWhen piled on salvers its aroma steeped\nThe summer, it should have a sacrament\nAnd celebration. Shrewd novitiates\nShould be the clerks of our experience.\nThese bland excursions into time to come,\nRelated in romance to backward flights,\nHowever prodigal, however proud,\nContained in their afflatus the reproach\nThat first drove Crispin to his wandering.\nHe could not be content with counterfeit,\nWith masquerade of thought, with hapless words\nThat must belie the racking masquerade,\nWith fictive flourishes that preordained\nHis passion's permit, hang of coat, degree\nOf buttons, measure of his salt. Such trash\nMight help the blind, not him, serenely sly.\nIt irked beyond his patience. Hence it was,\nPreferring text to gloss, he humbly served\nGrotesque apprenticeship to chance event,\nA clown, perhaps, but an aspiring clown.\nThere is a monotonous babbling in our dreams\nThat makes them our dependent heirs, the heirs\nOf dreamers buried in our sleep, and not\nThe oncoming fantasies of better birth.\nThe apprentice knew these dreamers. If he dreamed\nTheir dreams, he did it in a gingerly way.\nAll dreams are vexing. Let them be expunged.\nBut let the rabbit run, the cock declaim.\nTrinket pasticcio, flaunting skyey sheets,\nWith Crispin as the tiptoe cozener?\nNo, no: veracious page on page, exact.                                v                 A Nice Shady Home\nCrispin as hermit, pure and capable,\nDwelt in the land. Perhaps if discontent\nHad kept him still the pricking realist,\nChoosing his element from droll confect\nOf was and is and shall or ought to be,\nBeyond Bordeaux, beyond Havana, far\nBeyond carked Yucatan, he might have come\nTo colonize his polar planterdom\nAnd jig his chits upon a cloudy knee.\nBut his emprize to that idea soon sped.\nCrispin dwelt in the land and dwelling there\nSlid from his continent by slow recess\nTo things within his actual eye, alert\nTo the difficulty of rebellious thought\nWhen the sky is blue. The blue infected will.\nIt may be that the yarrow in his fields\nSealed pensive purple under its concern.\nBut day by day, now this thing and now that\nConfined him, while it cosseted, condoned,\nLittle by little, as if the suzerain soil\nAbashed him by carouse to humble yet\nAttach. It seemed haphazard denouement.\nHe first, as realist, admitted that\nWhoever hunts a matinal continent\nMay, after all, stop short before a plum\nAnd be content and still be realist.\nThe words of things entangle and confuse.\nThe plum survives its poems. It may hang\nIn the sunshine placidly, colored by ground\nObliquities of those who pass beneath,\nHarlequined and mazily dewed and mauved\nIn bloom. Yet it survives in its own form,\nBeyond these changes, good, fat, guzzly fruit.\nSo Crispin hasped on the surviving form,\nFor him, of shall or ought to be in is.\nWas he to bray this in profoundest brass\nArointing his dreams with fugal requiems?\nWas he to company vastest things defunct\nWith a blubber of tom-toms harrowing the sky?\nScrawl a tragedian's testament? Prolong\nHis active force in an inactive dirge,\nWhich, let the tall musicians call and call,\nShould merely call him dead? Pronounce amen\nThrough choirs infolded to the outmost clouds?\nBecause he built a cabin who once planned\nLoquacious columns by the ructive sea?\nBecause he turned to salad-beds again?\nJovial Crispin, in calamitous crape?\nShould he lay by the personal and make\nOf his own fate an instance of all fate?\nWhat is one man among so many men?\nWhat are so many men in such a world?\nCan one man think one thing and think it long?\nCan one man be one thing and be it long?\nThe very man despising honest quilts\nLies quilted to his poll in his despite.\nFor realists, what is is what should be.\nAnd so it came, his cabin shuffled up,\nHis trees were planted, his duenna brought\nHer prismy blonde and clapped her in his hands,\nThe curtains flittered and the door was closed.\nCrispin, magister of a single room,\nLatched up the night. So deep a sound fell down\nIt was as if the solitude concealed\nAnd covered him and his congenial sleep.\nSo deep a sound fell down it grew to be\nA long soothsaying silence down and down.\nThe crickets beat their tambours in the wind,\nMarching a motionless march, custodians.\nIn the presto of the morning, Crispin trod,\nEach day, still curious, but in a round\nLess prickly and much more condign than that\nHe once thought necessary. Like Candide,\nYeoman and grub, but with a fig in sight,\nAnd cream for the fig and silver for the cream,\nA blonde to tip the silver and to taste\nThe rapey gouts. Good star, how that to be\nAnnealed them in their cabin ribaldries!\nYet the quotidian saps philosophers\nAnd men like Crispin like them in intent,\nIf not in will, to track the knaves of thought.\nBut the quotidian composed as his,\nOf breakfast ribands, fruits laid in their leaves,\nThe tomtit and the cassia and the rose,\nAlthough the rose was not the noble thorn\nOf crinoline spread, but of a pining sweet,\nComposed of evenings like cracked shutters flung\nUpon the rumpling bottomness, and nights\nIn which those frail custodians watched,\nIndifferent to the tepid summer cold,\nWhile he poured out upon the lips of her\nThat lay beside him, the quotidian\nLike this, saps like the sun, true fortuner.\nFor all it takes it gives a humped return\nExchequering from piebald fiscs unkeyed.                               vi           And Daughters with Curls\nPortentous enunciation, syllable\nTo blessed syllable affined, and sound\nBubbling felicity in cantilene,\nProlific and tormenting tenderness\nOf music, as it comes to unison,\nForgather and bell boldly Crispin's last\nDeduction. Thrum, with a proud douceur\nHis grand pronunciamento and devise.\nThe chits came for his jigging, bluet-eyed,\nHands without touch yet touching poignantly,\nLeaving no room upon his cloudy knee,\nProphetic joint, for its diviner young.\nThe return to social nature, once begun,\nAnabasis or slump, ascent or chute,\nInvolved him in midwifery so dense\nHis cabin counted as phylactery,\nThen place of vexing palankeens, then haunt\nOf children nibbling at the sugared void,\nInfants yet eminently old, then dome\nAnd halidom for the unbraided femes,\nGreen crammers of the green fruits of the world,\nBidders and biders for its ecstasies,\nTrue daughters both of Crispin and his clay.\nAll this with many mulctings of the man,\nEffective colonizer sharply stopped\nIn the door-yard by his own capacious bloom.\nBut that this bloom grown riper, showing nibs\nOf its eventual roundness, puerile tints\nOf spiced and weathery rouges, should complex\nThe stopper to indulgent fatalist\nWas unforeseen. First Crispin smiled upon\nHis goldenest demoiselle, inhabitant,\nShe seemed, of a country of the capuchins,\nSo delicately blushed, so humbly eyed,\nAttentive to a coronal of things\nSecret and singular. Second, upon\nA second similar counterpart, a maid\nMost sisterly to the first, not yet awake\nExcepting to the motherly footstep, but\nMarvelling sometimes at the shaken sleep.\nThen third, a thing still flaxen in the light,\nA creeper under jaunty leaves.

at all who passed those vampires and angels you encountered, can you state for the record the moan you heard the ghosts emit across the nation-state,,, wuaahh buu,,, did you perform three miracles for

death and is this song the sonata we hear when we press those keys, was your tool to search for him a wishbone, did you slice the wishbone from the breast of a monstrous old god, who was the god, what was his username, was it one of the ghost-giants you fled from terrified that he may have glimpsed even a shred of you, was it the famished god who grabs small ghosts to its mouth and slurps down their marrow, was it a devourer whose fingerprints leak out red tears in hysterical shame, was it Francisco Pizarro, was it King Leopold, did you see Joe Arpaio levitating each leg borne aloft by flying police cars, did you see Winston Churchill that infant-faced faminist turning loose new Emergencies, was it Andrew Jackson mounting a scorpion across that moist trail this pilgrimage for

his rib cage, did you hold the bone\u2019s moist handles up into the sky and poke that plump cloud with your dowsing rod, did the stick sniff out your father from this city of ghosts until this wet rod twitched, until the witching stick tugged you through hell\u2019s alleyways, until you arrived here at this modest house, what category of building is the house that contains your father, until you found a prison, until you found a shadowless space where he waited underneath a star, is death the story of until, is death the story you came to untell, did the light emit a silence like hssssssshs, this light the star wept\u2014was it a message from the past strewn across black heaven, an emergency beacon from a plague universe calling help help from masters and money, what sound do you hear arrayed against you (here the ghost chorus leaps and screams keke keke!), did the star halt above that house like a police chopper spotlight, basking its blue heat on your skin, was this when the star\u2019s strange beams obliterated your shadow, did you cry no please my shadow is all I have here, did you say without my shadow I am a ghost, without my shadow I have no history, how did you feel when the star cried and wailed down its weep-light in fragile pink lineaments, did you see the star throned above where your father may be waiting, is your father the king who sleeps in a cave beneath the city or does his life continue in this mute house, is he washing the dishes as we speak, is he talking on the phone in that loud way of his, is he watching a K-Drama while eating \u725b \u8089 \u9eb5, did he clip the soup\u2019s recipe from that most authentic of sources Gourmet magazine, had you bought him the subscription for his birthday and was his reply to you months later, \u201cFine, these French can cook but take away butter and they don\u2019t know how to do anything,\u201d (hahahahaha say the ghosts) was that many years ago now in fact probably a decade, did you just glance down at your wristwatch to show how many days are left in your very own life, do the manic watch hands ratchet around like helicopter blades chuh chuh chuh, were you given this watch from your future self that renegade timelord, do you have the time, is time something one can possess or does it soar away from us on outspread wings, but doesn\u2019t D\u014dgen say that time does not fly since it does not exist outside of us, is it impossible to exist outside the underworld, did you open the front door to the house and see the living room from your childhood, the white Naugahyde couch preserving the dark halo that he cast when he dozed off during his hair dye, the cubic light of a TV luminous solely from VHF, and framed by the window: a blue Honda, car of his youth!,,, these nostalgic recreations do they make you wonder if you had somehow time traveled to a coordinate outside of the underworld, traveled to the past, or would it be more accurate to say that we are already inside the underworld, that the apocalypse is not a spectacle but what elapses as we speak, what does it mean to speak,, ha ha blah blah blah,,,, did you tour the house of memory saying nothing, did you find the doors to each room shut, all handles locked, is this how your waking brain prohibits all fantasies, is it true that they have outlawed dreams, who is they, did you come to your bedroom door and open your wallet to take out your key, did you see on a dollar the face of an evil god, did Andrew Jackson wink at you from the currency and bare his fangs hsss sa sa,,,,,,, was this when the five dollar bill singed you, did the sign of the apocalyptic populist ignite and burn out the grooves from your fingerprints, how loud did you holler shocked, did your wallet keep falling into the floor and never stop, did the floor wobble like a trampoline, did a menacing voice laugh and say on god\u2019s intercom here is your shadow catch, did you fall through the hole in the carpet, did you land in one of the old sewers and in the distance see someone sleeping on a stone slab, was it a body curled to the side uncovered by any blanket, did you talk on the phone with the woman from the ambulance, was it true that your sister and your stepmother saw his body covered only with a sheet, did the woman tell you what she had seen and do you remember telling her \u201cYou have a terrible job\u2014you must tell everyone that the one they love has died,\u201d did you recognize her when you entered this place and saw the Recording Angel, is the occupation of that archivist of prayers: writer, did the sleeping figure roll back as though on an airport conveyer, do the walls of the cave inch closer to strangle you, is the underworld a prison since those who enter it have no right to return, who will rescue you, who will rescue you now that you have lathered yourself with cave, is it true that you have forgotten how to breathe, did you aspire to be as breathless as the ghosts who populate this place or did you just have a bad day, would you like to stop, would you like to stop and catch your breath huh huhh huh, did you simultaneously call your expression narcissism and your restraint self-loathing, doubly self-damning, have you been given permission to forgive yourself, shall you ask the mirror Uncle what ails thee, what about your dowsing rod, will you wish for water, wish for air, witch for heir, did you tap your bone wand to the gray rocks repressing you, did the earth and its baroque caverns transpire into the simple night about you, did you look down through the wind from a ship sailing dark heights, did you find the ship\u2019s steadiness strange given that nothing supported you above sky and city, well is the air nothing, was it the Maya who said that soul was simply breath, is the soul nothing, what if you crept into the airship\u2019s spacious caverns and saw not helium but a palace of flowers, what if the entire vessel had been borne up by the exhalations of flowers their breath tasting sweet into the air, what if this was the world, what if you lived on a planet that had grown itself from the souls of flowers, did you once believe that grief was the philosopher\u2019s stone whose touch silenced all spacetime into dark matter, on Sunday did you meet a man at the market who had returned to Haiti the day before the earthquake, did he tell you what that taught him, was the lesson to quit his job and love his daughter and begin afresh, did he remind you that you imagine the world for your child, is the poet what we name the vocation of love and freedom, on that first summer day in March did your child\u2019s grandparents text you Christos Anesti, did you sit yourself down in the airship\u2019s aisles unsuspended by clouds and float in the silver air, buoyed by nothing so magical as resurrection, did you take a deep breath and accept an in-flight complimentary beverage, did you gaze out the window at the spill of stars and

He was,\nBeyond the arsons of levity and his toe,\nThe final bulwark of the baroque.\nHe was the last to oppose, \u201calmost\nSuccessfully,\u201d rebirth on all the wrong terms.\nHe saw the leaf alone where no light was.\nInfinite variation plays against\nA steadfast variety.

Only after I kill something\u2014a person, perhaps an animal, even a chicken\u2014can I calm down.... I am sad that Your Majesty does not love me and terrified when you criticize me. All this turns to anger.\u201d \u201cYour Majesty,\u201d here, refers to the king, his father.\r\nThe female figure is never directly quoted, but Pseudo-Apollodorus writes that she casts a spell upon the king her husband so that when he has sex with another woman, he ejaculates wild creatures into the woman\u2019s vagina, thereby killing her. Although the punishment is enacted on the body of the woman, this punishment is meant to deter the king from slaking his desires.\r\nBoth figures, royal themselves, are angry at the king, but neither attempts to kill the king\u2014which would be political. Instead they displace this anger onto other unnamed deaths, which are considered sexual but not political.\r\nBoth figures have spouses known for strategy, for self-preservation in \u2028politically tumultuous times, times of many unnamed deaths.\r\nBoth figures are counterfoils to their strategizing spouses, figures of excessive \u2028desire, requiring containment.\r\nBoth containers are wooden.\r\nBoth containers are camouflaged with a soft, yielding substance\u2014one with grass, one with fur.\r\nBoth containers are ingenious solutions to seemingly intractable problems.\r\nOne problem is political. One problem is sexual.\r\nThey are both the same problem.\r\nThey have the same solution.\r\nThe male figure waits in the container for death to come. He waits for eight days. His son will live. This ensures the succession, the frictionless transfer of power.\r\nThe female figure waits in the container for the generation of a life. We do not know how long she waits. Her son will die, after waiting in his own wooden container. This ensures the succession, the frictionless transfer of power.\r\nThere are many artistic representations of both containers.\r\nThe male figure\u2019s container is blockish, unadorned, a household object of standard size and quotidian function. Tourists climb into it and pose for photos, post them online. The cramped position of their bodies generates a combination of horror and glee. This, in turn, creates discomfort, the recognition that horror and glee should not be combined, that such a combination is taboo.\r\nThe female figure\u2019s container is customized, lushly contoured. Its contours are excessively articulated to the same degree that her desire is excessively articulated. Artists depict the container in cutaway view, revealing the female figure within, awaiting the wild creature. The abject position of the female figure\u2014on all fours, pressing her genitalia back against the hollow cow\u2019s genitalia\u2014generates a combination of lust and revenge. This, in turn, creates discomfort\u2014the recognition that lust and revenge should not be combined, that wild creatures and female figures should not be combined, that these combinations are taboo.\r\nHot button topics are taboo because they generate discomfort.\r\nThe male figure slakes his violent desires and is punished. The male figure also functions as a hot button, a means whereby the violent desires of tourists \u2028are slaked, while generating discomfort in these tourists.\r\nThe female figure slakes her sexual desires and is punished. The female \u2028figure also functions as a hot button, a means whereby the sexual desires of artists are slaked, while generating discomfort in these artists.\r\nThe tourist can climb into the rice chest. The tourist can pose for a photo in the rice chest. Then the tourist can climb out of the rice chest and walk away.\r\nThe artist can look into the hollow cow. The artist can render the contours of the hollow cow, the contours of the female figure. Then the artist can walk away.\r\nBoth containers allow the tourist and artist to touch the hot button, the taboo.\r\nThe desire and the discomfort remain contained.\r\nBoth containers allow the tourist and the artist to walk away.\r\nThe male and female figures remain contained.\r\nNeither container\u2014the rice chest, the hollow cow\u2014appears to have any necessary connection to race.\r\nTo mention race where it is not necessary to mention race is taboo.\r\nI have not mentioned the race of the tourist or the artist.\r\nThe tourist and the artist are allowed to pass for white.\r\nThe tourist and the artist are not contained.\r\nI have already mentioned the race of the poet.\r\nBut to the extent that the poet is not contained, the poet is allowed to pass for white.\r\nI have already mentioned the race of the male and female figures.\r\nThe male and female figures are contained.\r\nThe rice chest and the hollow cow are containers.\r\nThe rice chest and the hollow cow are not the only containers in this poem.\r\nColchis and Korea are containers in this poem.\r\nAsianness is a container in this poem.\r\nRace is a container in this poem.\r\nEach of these containers contains desire and its satisfaction.\r\nEach of these containers contains discomfort and deterrence.\r\nEach of these containers contains a hot button, a taboo.\r\nThe tourist and the artist can enter each of these containers.\r\nThe tourist and the artist can touch the hot button and walk away.\r\nEach of these containers separates the slaking of desire from the punishment of desire.\r\nEach of these containers is an ingenious solution to a seemingly intractable problem.\r\nThey are the same problem.\r\nThey have the same solution.\r\nEach of these containers ensures the frictionless transfer of power.\r\nEach of these containers holds a male or female figure.\r\nThe name of the male figure can be translated as \u201cThink of me in sadness.\u201d\r\nThe name of the female figure can be translated as \u201cI shine for all of you.\u201d"}, {"1": {"godforsaken places walking friends": [4, 5, 6, 62]}, "3": {"far thought friends": [11, 17, 62]}, "4": {"places beach friends": [5, 9, 62]}, "6": {"places alone horseshoe": [5, 10, 21]}, "9": {"dead sea a black cover": [14, 15, 20, 30, 32]}, "10": {"godforsaken places the beach": [4, 5, 8, 9]}, "12": {"godforsaken places the beach": [4, 5, 8, 9]}, "13": {"i know was washed": [0, 1, 26, 35]}, "14": {"dead sea a black cover": [14, 15, 20, 30, 32]}, "15": {"places beach friends gave": [5, 9, 62, 66]}, "poem": "I know something about godforsaken places.\nWalking on the beach alone, far from the Dead Sea,\nI thought I saw a horseshoe crab crawling slowly\u2014\nit was a Gideon Society, black Bible cover.\nAnother time, washed up on a Montauk dune,\nI found a Chianti wine bottle\nwith a letter in it.

Something to hold on to behind the spread of the sickness of mud, fermentation. But there is nothing to grasp beneath this mantle of slippery webbed skin, burst through by a pounding net of veins.\r\n \r\nI now lick my tongue against the outer claws of the fingers to tear life into the ions, to make sores bitter in the tongue\u2019s blue ventricles. A kind of pain therefore radiates against the inner glands, a faint spasm of cheers before this, the nervous system\u2019s last chance to communicate with the dying I. The mists smart, shimmer, the lumps of blue cobalt from the mustard gas corrode through the otherwise red shroud-clouds that drag their bellies against the river\u2019s surface. In one of the skin-folds between the pockets of the genital dress, lizards gather in heaps of glimmering scales.\r\n \r\nBut time runs on time and starvation and the weakness carries me in across the gray regions. And the soul\u2019s dark night will slowly be lowered through me. That is why I now slowly fold myself like a muscle against the wet clay to press the flesh against the sleep-gland\u2019s mouths.

I smile for my portrait,\ncurious at the New Year, smelling the acrid smoke\nof the one we've just destroyed.

It was launched by Iran in July 1982 near Basra and featured the use of human wave attacks in one of the largest land battles since World War II. Aftermath: The operation was the first of many disastrous offensives which cost thousands of lives on both sides. This one in general boosted the casualty limit up to 80,000 killed, 200,000 wounded, and 45,000 captured. In retrospect, the Iranians lacked effective command and control, air support, and logistics to sustain an attack in the first place. Saddam Hussein offered several ceasefire attempts in the following year, none of which were accepted by the Revolutionary regime.

Their nail beds a bit purplish.\r\nThere\u2019s a Caesar cipher decoder ring in their shredded wheat and, unsure of what to decode first, Yael hides it under their pillow. Yael says, Today I\u2019ll be lonely. They need the practice.\r\nYael never drinks their cereal milk, pours it back into the jug. But they are thirsty. Outside of their tent, the lawn is still entirely a lawn\u2009\u2014\u2009the neighbors kept to themselves last night, trampled none of the daffodils. A good omen. Today Yael can leave their tent without fear. Of what? The omen has no answer, it presents only the bright of things.\r\nYael shoves three empty bottles into their bag and heads toward the river.\r\n \r\n\r\n\u2022\n\n\r\nThe pigs are having a swim and pay Yael no mind as they submerge each bottle. Yael imagines the bubbles that shimmy out are the \u2028bottle\u2019s breath, that they have the power to take breath from anyone.\r\nThe hair on their arms turns golden. Then the water. Then the pigs flee. Yael looks down as Sun approaches. They were already kneeling. \u2028Their shins disrupting the path of an ant colony\u2019s leaf-carrying \u2028ceremony. The ants do not bite Yael\u2009\u2014\u2009Sun is watching, and the ants like being alive, love to feel the weight of a veiny leaf, love even more the sound their mandibles make piercing through that leaf.\r\nSun kicks a flowering fennel as He walks toward Yael, but forgets to change the wind\u2019s direction. The seeds blow into Yael\u2019s hair and up their nose. Though Yael did not see Him do it, Sun gives himself away by whining, It\u2019s not my fault.\r\n \r\n\r\n\u2022\n\n\r\nSun\u2019s whine reminds Yael of their husband, Heber. Heber whines like that when Yael wants to leave his tent. When Yael doesn\u2019t invite him into their tent. When Yael doesn\u2019t want to watch a movie that Heber has seen a dozen times.\r\nIt\u2019s exhausting to be shown things, to try to enjoy a movie while also giving a convincing performance of that enjoyment. Heber ruins these screenings\u2009\u2014\u2009he weeps before the scenes that call for weeping. He mouths each pivotal line.\r\nSo far, Yael has spent their life absorbing men\u2019s favorites. On the rare occasion that Heber does ask to watch their favorite movie, Yael can\u2019t remember having one. This makes Yael feel a creaking, hollow-boned kind of gloom.\r\nThis gloom opens the flaps in their brain that make them want to lie in bed all day.\r\nYael does not know the sound of their loudest yell. All their noises \u2028have been practiced. Maybe this is why Sun\u2019s whine makes their cheeks flush. The sound is a selfish one. Why should it go unpunished?\r\n \r\n\r\n\u2022\n\n\r\nSometimes, when they think of Heber away at war, Yael grows giddy, \u2028presses their smile hard into their pillow until the whirling joy \u2028subsides. But what is the mainspring of that giddiness? They try to dissect the thought:\n\r\n          Heber = Giddy\r\n                    Or\r\n                              Heber away = Giddy\r\n                                        Or\r\n                                                  Heber away at war = Giddy\r\n \r\n\u2022\n\n\r\nIf Yael were to look up from the dirt, they\u2019d see the kestrels circling above, their left talons leashed to Sun\u2019s wrist by neon green fishing line. Taut line. No give.\r\nYael won\u2019t look up.\r\nSun exhales and lets loose His belly. It peeks out from under His shirt. You can keep thinking of me as Sun. He\u2019s relieved Yael is alone. I\u2019ve been looking for a new name. His old name felt stale. Dead by comparison. Sun is perfect.I have a very important job for you, Yael, descendant of\u2009\u2014\u2009He\u2019d left His notes at home\u2009\u2014\u2009Yael.

We've paid our dues. Our hearts are inscribed\nwith loss after loss.\" For some reason, after everything, our rib cages\nheld up and continued to cradle tender hearts. They must have figured\nthat all the prayers and careful teachings would prevent bruises\nthat would weaken us.

Headlights had begun to flare in the cool dusk. The hum of the car's engine lulled me, and I put my forehead against the glass, looking out over a darkening landscape. We were headed to the Bishop's Ranch, a weekend retreat for Episcopal Young Churchmen in hilly country that would someday produce superlative wines with garnet hues that stain the inside of a glass. I was queasy from the lurching of the car, the stops and starts, the smell of exhaust. Though trembling with cold, I was too shy to ask the lady, the mother of one of the other girls, to turn on the heater. I imagined pale pink blossoms on the Japanese plum, apple trees laden with white flowers, and north of Sebastapol the vibrant yellow of daffodils on slender, pleated stems. That night I slept in a single bunk made up with thin sheets and blankets.\r\n \r\nA warm sun the next day restored me, but in the evening, seated by the fire that crackled in the fireplace of the big lodge, I felt flushed. Our recently ordained curate (we were not to know he was gay till some years later) had asked me to bring my guitar, and now he wanted me to sing about the girl who decides to sleep next to her mother her whole life long instead of falling for an unfaithful suitor. I sang; we all sang together. Young Father W. had a wonderful tenor voice. His smile reassured me, but now I was tired and, earlier than the others, I decided to return to the dorm.\r\n \r\nIn that clear March night, the sky gleamed like black ink and stars blazed, bright and alive. Walking downhill, guitar in hand, I suddenly stumbled with dizziness, and the slope swam before me. \u201cHold on, hold on,\u201d I told myself as I nearly fell onto the dew-slick lawn. For a moment I could sense myself floating away from my body. Back in the dorm, I crawled into bed and lay shuddering with cold, bones aching. The room seemed to spin. I wanted to be home, but the thought of facing my mother filled me with terrible dismay. I knew the blue failure notice mailed by the school would have arrived.\r\n \r\nSure enough, it lay open on the dining table when I got home the following afternoon. A Sunday fog, hardly a mist, had blown in from the bay and was gathering in the eucalyptus across the ravine. The house was steamy. A basket of clean laundry occupied a chair atop a stack of San Francisco Chronicles. Mom sat at the table sewing, but I knew she was scowling. I thought it wise to look industrious, so I began to fold towels and pillowcases. \u201cWhat I want to know,\u201d began my mother, \u201cis whether you have any ambition? Obviously, you will never get to college. What do you expect to do with your life?\u201d She paused, and I shrugged. \u201cGo ahead and shrug. Do you think your girlfriend is going to take care of you? That won\u2019t last long. And why is it you only fall in love with girls? Well, I suppose you want to be a boy.\u201d What an unutterable failure I am. I retreated, burned by her ferocious, upright anger. \u201cOh, yes, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re sick! But you will go to school tomorrow!\u201d\r\n \r\nThat night, wracked again with cold, unable to stop my trembling, I sought my parents\u2019 bed, stood moaning till Mom woke and let me under the covers, where she tried to warm me with her body. Weeks later we learned that one of my classmates, a robust girl who shot baskets as well as any boy, had succumbed to the illness and died. That night, my mother placed her hand on my forehead\u2013her smooth palm, her touch, gentle\u2013and said to my barely awake dad, \u201cOur daughter has a raging fever.\u201d Like a miracle, I was still her child.

I was very thin. As if I\u2019d lived on air. A poet must be able to live on air, but a mother must not attempt it. My mother wanted me to buy a set of matching pots, Wearever aluminum, like the ones she had. They were heavy and had well fitting lids so my suppers wouldn\u2019t burn. My husband wanted me to give dinner parties. John F. Kennedy was running for office.\r\n \r\nI sensed danger. Kennedy wasn\u2019t against the Bomb or for nuclear disarmament. I joined SANE at its inception. Also Concerned Scientists. I spoke with Linus Pauling and encouraged my husband to help his partner organize Physicians for Social Responsibility.\r\n \r\nThere was a baby in my belly. I wanted to write poems. I had a crazy idea that a woman could write a real novel, the kind that shook the world. I hallucinated that a woman could be a poet, but she would have to be free. I couldn\u2019t imagine that freedom for myself even though I could see it in Isla Negra when I followed Pablo Neruda. I could see it in the way he walked. Even if he were walking inside a dictatorship, among guns, soldiers and spies, there was nothing between him and his vision. Anything he saw, he was able to take into himself\u2013there was no sight, no image, no vision to which he didn\u2019t feel entitled. In his heart, everything\u2013everything\u2013belonged to him. Pablo Neruda was\u2013more than anything\u2013a poet, and so he was an entitled man.\r\n \r\nI was a woman and entitled to nothing. I had nothing except a husband, a rented house, a set of pots, living room furniture, a frenzy of obligations, credit cards, anxious relatives, too many acquaintances, a gift of future diaper service, two telephones, no time to read, a plastic wrapped cookbook of recipes gleaned from the pages of the New York Times, and a hunger, a terrible hunger for the unimaginable, unlimited freedom of being a poet, and a baby in my belly.\r\n \r\nI would have called Pablo long distance if I had the courage, if I had the ability to speak Spanish fluently, if we had ever talked about real things. But, what would a man know about a baby in the belly? And what did it matter if there were to be one poet more or less in the world when so many in his country were dying?\r\n \r\nI woke up one morning and thought\u2013I can\u2019t have this child. My husband said, \u201cYou\u2019ll have to get a job after it\u2019s born so we can buy a house. You\u2019ll need an advanced degree so you can do something.\u201d I thought, I can\u2019t. I have to write poems. My mother found a crib. Someone painted it white. A friend sent a pastel mobile with tame wood animals. I thought about blue curtains, making bedspreads, and abortions.\r\n \r\nPablo was silent. He was walking so far from me, I couldn\u2019t hear him. My husband objected to donating more free medical care to the Black Panthers. I tried to make dolmades from scratch and located grape leaves preserved in brine at the Boys\u2019 Market twenty miles away. I organized a write-in campaign for peace to challenge JFK. My husband thought it would be nice to have teatime with the children and romantic dinners by ourselves. The new formula bottles lined up on the sink like tiny bombs. The U.S. was pursuing over ground testing; I was afraid the radiation would cross the milk barrier. I had a poem in me howling for real life but no language to write in. The fog came in thick, flapping about my feet like blankets unraveling. I became afraid to have a daughter.\r\n \r\nI called Pablo Neruda in the middle of the night as he walked underwater by Isla Negra. He moved like a dream porpoise. He seemed pregnant with words. They came out of his penis in long miraculous strings. The sea creatures quivered with joy. I said, \u201cPablo, I want to know how to bear the child in my belly onto this bed of uranium and I want to know if a woman can a be a poet.\u201d He was large as a whale. He drank the sea and spouted it in glistening odes, black and shiny. I said, \u201cI can\u2019t have this child,\u201d and he laughed as if he had never done anything but carry and birth children.\r\n \r\nSo I packed my little bag as if I were going to the hospital and I left a note and the Wearever pots and sterilized nipples upon the glass missiles, and took the cradle board than an American Indian friend had given me for the baby and that had made my husband snort\u2013 \u201cYou\u2019re not going to carry the thing on your back, are you?\u201d I took some money, the car, some books, paper and pens, my walking shoes, an unwieldly IBM electric typewriter, my pregnant belly and a dozen cloth diapers, and I went out.\r\n \r\nI knew how to carry a baby and how to carry a poem and I would learn how to have a baby and even how to have a poem. I would have enough milk for both. I would learn how to walk with them. But I didn\u2019t know, and I didn\u2019t want to know, how to have a husband and a matched set of Wearever pots."}, {"3": {"utterly passed animals": [44, 49, 87]}, "4": {"want animals stock": [11, 87, 98]}, "9": {"livid dream the worst rest": [24, 32, 33, 34, 43]}, "11": {"want animals another such color": [11, 87, 101, 108, 109]}, "13": {"we made was brought": [0, 2, 67, 79]}, "14": {"livid dream the worst rest": [24, 32, 33, 34, 43]}, "15": {"want animals stock": [11, 87, 98]}, "poem": "We were made to understand it would be\nTerrible.

Park, an area with a long history of widespread industrial activity. From this one locality, in the second half of the nineteenth century, more than thirty thousand tons of copper ore were raised, processed, and shipped for smelting. In 1859, in order to stabilize and increase the power supply, Wheal Emma Leat (a fifteen-mile-long channel) was cut across moorland and around woodland valleys to transport water from the River Swincombe and to feed the mines by supplementing the Mardle, a tributary of the Dart. Some of this now empty moorland waterway can be walked today on Dartmoor. I am grateful to Kevin and Donna Cox, owners of the Brook Manor estate, for showing my collaborator, Ignacio Acosta, and me over the remains of mine workings on their land.\n\r\nWidening the plug doorway\r\non the bob wall left no\r\nsurface evidence.

How does he know\nme, and why is he so interested? Once\na parrot took stock of me, learnt to speak\nmy name in exactly the tones I said it in,\nmimicked it endlessly and so loudly\nthat I ran from my laughing friend\u2019s house\nwith my shrill-voiced name hurling after me.3\nWhere does the owl go during the day?\nHow can he know I\u2019ll still be here\nwhen he surfaces?

When can I\nexpect his sounds to morph into spoken\nwords that I understand and act on,\nif I agree with him? But if I decide\nto stay put, never leave the bedroom,\nwill he get fed up standing there\nand row away through the night air,\nhooting a farewell? I don\u2019t think so,\nno, this fellow is here for the duration\nof my stay on this enormous ball\nand could tell right now how long that\nwill be, and what messy adventures\nare still ahead of me, but his trick is\nto keep as schtum on such stuff as\nthe wooden owl on my bedside table.4\nI\u2019ve heard stories about owls, how they\nappear from nowhere at the edge of things\nto sit watching, usually staying silent,\nbut sometimes uttering a few words in\ntheir night language we don\u2019t understand.\nThat\u2019s my fellow, although I don\u2019t know him.\nShould I leave the house and hold my\nright arm out for him to land on and turn\nhis big eyes on me? As if he\u2019d be so compliant.\nOr should I try to forget him, pretend\nhe\u2019s not there in the dark, like a tree\nI hadn\u2019t noticed growing? Oh, at least\nI should stop mentioning him here, but what\nelse can I write about? Not the journey\nI\u2019m taking that I know nothing of, not yet,\nand when I do I mightn\u2019t feel like writing.\nI think the solution might be to buy\na T-shirt with an owl printed on it,\na blue owl, on a yellow shirt, and write\nabout that small fellow to begin with.5\nWhat I want to learn is this: do owls\never venture inside, to stand on a corner-\ntable, cock their heads to one side,\nand take in completely what\u2019s going on?\nThere are mice here that may be welcome,\nbut I know my owl would be suspicious.\nHe\u2019d assume I want him inside to see\nwhat he looks like, to make friends with him,\nso he\u2019ll be kind to me. I could promise\nto wear a blindfold and say nothing,\nact like I don\u2019t know he\u2019s there, but I will\nknow and that\u2019s enough. I think I hear\nhis thoughts and I\u2019m sure he hears mine.\nI feel his big eyes on me all the time.\nMaybe I should start carrying the wooden\nowl around with me, and practice owl noises.\nWhen is he going to tell me what he has to?\nI\u2019m not asking for a map, but I\u2019d like to know\nwhere I\u2019m headed, if not where I\u2019ll end up.\nAnd I\u2019d like to know it as soon as I can.6\nWhen I say I hear his thoughts, I hear some,\nnot the important ones. And here\u2019s one\nof mine\u2009\u2014\u2009if he ventured inside this house\nhe\u2019d see something that might intrigue him,\na hand-knitted toilet roll cover, in rings of\npurple, red, and white. Like an unknown planet\nhanging in the sky. I\u2019d let him have it, take it\nback to his nest, or his hollow tree trunk, or his\nhalf-sunken boat. I know he\u2019ll assume this\nis another example of special pleading,\nand I accept that. Would I do better to ignore\nhim, let him stay out there, like a pinecone\nthat remains unobserved? I saw my doctor\nyesterday, he spoke of the deterioration,\nand I felt the owl was hiding in a cupboard,\nagreeing with every word. After that I went\nto my sister\u2019s grave and the owl flew back\nto wherever he\u2019s been ordered to lurk\nwhile observing me. Maybe I should feel\nprivileged to have his full-time attention.7\nThis morning I captured a beetle climbing\nthe parsley. I put him in an empty matchbox,\nwondering what the owl thought of this.\nWould it impact what might be unfolding?\nI doubted this. I slipped on some spidery jazz\nthat I knew would annoy the owl. He needed\nto be in control. I ground coffee beans\nand made espresso. The aroma wafted through\nthe house. I freed the beetle to explore\nthe table, and when it wandered off the edge\nI let it. I\u2019m sure it survived, but I\u2019m not bothered,\njust as I know the owl doesn\u2019t care about me.\nWe are thrown together, all of us, by winds\nthat come here from far-off worlds. I sipped\nmy coffee, humming the tune spun through\nthe jazz, and I felt quite well for the first time\nin weeks, even months. Was the owl watching\u2009\u2014\u2009\nhad he been in contact with the beetle?\nAnd what was their collective verdict on me?\nDid it add up to more negative evidence?8\nOK, I\u2019m blanking him. I watched a crow today,\nreally admired how he operated, looking\nafter the young ones, his partner, none of\nthis spying on others. I\u2019ve decided I don\u2019t like\nowls, their self-absorption, or their nosiness\nabout people. I know which I\u2019d rather be.\nAnd I don\u2019t have to deal with a crow stalking me.\nThe owl would laugh about these thoughts.\nHe\u2019s been given the task of waiting to release,\nwhen he can, exactly what I need to know\nor what he can reveal. I admit he\u2019s not easy\nbut, shit, he\u2019s the dumb card I\u2019ve been dealt\nand I have to pretend I like him. Can I ask him\nabout the Oxford and Cambridge rowers,\nor about the hairdressers the Louisianians use,\nor the tiger cubs that Texans keep as pets?\nThe owl would make minced meat of them all.\nI wish he would hoot another noise to me.\nI might even acknowledge his importance,\ngiven my situation, but I won\u2019t reveal anything.9\nI felt the presence of the owl last night.\nHe was in the room with me. Not literally\u2009\u2014\u2009\nhe appeared in a dream, where a blue van\nstruggled up an icy road before sliding back\nin a horrible, wriggling way, to what felt\nlike an end. I\u2019m not sure how it seemed so.\nAnd I can\u2019t say where the owl was in this\nlittle film, except he was definitely there.\nThis morning I came down the stairs,\nexpecting some sign from him. I found\na few brown feathers on a white plate\non the kitchen table. OK, then, he must be\na brown owl, but why donate some feathers,\nand what did these denote? I made coffee,\nthen put on a CD of Anouar Brahem\u2019s oud\nthat seemed to suit the moment. And I\ndecided it was the time to poach two eggs\nto serve on top of two slices of rye bread\nwhile I primed the espresso machine again\nand asked myself what the owl was saying.10\nThose feathers were gone from the plate\nwhen I went back for them this evening,\nso I wondered if maybe I\u2019d imagined them,\nor if they\u2019d fluttered up from the eggs\nbefore I\u2019d poached them. That doubt was\ncaused by the owl, I was sure\u2009\u2014\u2009I\u2019d made him\ncareless, and he was recovering his poise,\nhis control. And I was back in the place\nwhere I knew nothing, where he liked me to be.\nI opened the door and stood there, listening,\nbut no owl sound came. Then a bat just barely\navoided my head, and glided toward the moon.\nI stood watching this leathery fellow, then\nclosed the door, and opened some wine.\nHow much did the owl control? Would I\nbe attacked by a rat tonight while I slept,\nnot savagely, but enough to terrify me?\nOr would cockroaches swarm on my duvet,\nclicking enough to wake me? The idea being\nthat these would render me so punch-drunk\nI\u2019d welcome whatever the owl had to say.11\nI spent the morning drawing owl after owl\non bits of paper, and after I\u2019d got somewhere\nnear a proper depiction, I found a black marker\nand reproduced it on an A2 drawing page\nwhich I Pritt Sticked onto the gable wall, then\nI dug out my old black bow and four arrows\nand unleashed these into the body of the owl.\nI knew I was being provocative, maybe even\nlaunching an act of war, but I could take no\nmore, and couldn\u2019t see what I had to lose.\nThe owl clearly was unmoved by this, so I\nrepeated the desecration four times over\ntill the drawn owl looked machine-gunned,\nwhereupon I flung the bow down on the grass\nand went in to pour a large glass of  Talisker\nfor the first time in months, if not years.\nIt still tasted good. I slipped on Kind of Blue,\nwhich always chilled me, and lay on the sofa\nwith my shoes kicked off, and the curtains\nwide open. I thought, let the owl do his worst.12\nWhen the dark came, I lurked in the kitchen,\nbow in hand, arrows in the quiver that hung\nfrom my left shoulder, like the Robin Hood\nI wanted to play in the school pantomime\u2009\u2014\u2009\nI got Little John instead! I kept looking out at\nthe dark garden, wondering if I should be there,\nwaiting to fire arrows at any sound or movement.\nWhy did I want to kill the owl? He hadn\u2019t given\nme the news I dreaded, but he\u2019d stayed silent.\nThat was more than I could bear. I poured a\nglass of Malbec and put on a CD of Baltic jazz.\nDid he think I could wait forever, as if I were\na rock? I sliced some cheddar and a heel of bread,\nopened the back door and went out. The moon\nturned its big eye onto me, and I saw it wobble.\nThe stars hummed along. Where am I going?\nI shouted at all of them. There was no response.\nThen far off, I heard a faint huhuhu followed by\na whoo. You cowardly bastard! I roared, and\nsprayed the arrows all over the blackened world."}, {"0": {"the word las iswat": [13, 14, 43, 46]}, "1": {"last night las iswat": [20, 21, 43, 46]}, "3": {"so lluvia class": [0, 9, 25]}, "4": {"d\u00e9jame class hail": [1, 25, 34]}, "6": {"d\u00e9jame hojas iswat as the windows": [1, 44, 46, 221, 225, 226]}, "9": {"ateltiw atelti the hojas iswat as the windows": [19, 22, 36, 44, 46, 221, 225, 226]}, "11": {"d\u00e9jame class the hojas iswat as the windows": [1, 25, 36, 44, 46, 221, 225, 226]}, "13": {"you hear was brings if": [32, 33, 69, 82, 281]}, "14": {"ateltiw atelti the hojas iswat as the windows carpet": [19, 22, 36, 44, 46, 221, 225, 226, 233]}, "15": {"d\u00e9jame class hail las of y abuelas": [1, 25, 34, 43, 72, 100, 101]}, "poem": "So d\u00e9jame\ncontarte\nun cuento, una historia\nes que\nlluvia    rain       agh       what\u2019s the word                     tey tey\nat?                       eltiw?

As he had two wives, the king cut the mango into two perfect halves and offered one half to each wife. After nine months, each wife gave birth to one lifeless half. Horrified, the king ordered these clots of flesh to be left in the forest. A wandering demon found the two lifeless halves and cupped one in each palm. When she brought them together, the two halves fused and a whole child was made in front of her eyes\u2014the demon named the child Jarasandha.\r\nYears passed by and this child grew to be an intimidating and invincible warrior. In a fight with Bhim, an equally invincible warrior, Jarasandha was ripped in half by his enemy. But, each time he was ripped apart, his halves found a way to meet up and become whole. Krishna, who witnessed how Jarasandha\u2019s flesh found its own way back to flesh, motioned to his own cousin with his fingers: toss the halves of his body in opposite directions, he\r\nsuggested.\r\nSo, when Bhim ripped Jarasandha apart once again, he swung his left half to the right side of the arena and his right half to the left. And his body found no way to return to itself.\r\nIn the Toronto airport, where I\u2019ve arrived for a conference, I watch an older Punjabi lady\u2014made to sit in a wheelchair behind two lines of customs officials, a security guard, a translator, and a service-staff member\u2014scream that her son is outside the airport may she please just go tell him she is here she is here she is here please.

I imagined New England snows dusting California and Miami\u2019s beaches stretched across Appalachia. America was a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 parody patched together by a cheaply hired prop maker. Geographic accuracy was sacrificed to the interpersonal dramas of Betty and Veronica, and the American banquet was limited to the malted and fried offerings in Pop\u2019s Chock\u2019lit Shoppe, where the Riverdale gang solved the real geopolitical problems of how to get Reggie off Moose\u2019s back with the help of Archie\u2019s fumbling charms. Here, class warfare came with a side of fries. There were rumors of distant family members \u201csettling\u201d in \u201cNorth Dakota\u201d or \u201cOklahoma\u201d\u2014names that put themselves together like Lego castles: hard-edged and jutting out with an abrupt L or a particularly pokey K.\nBlackness was just a rumor too. Blackness flickered in the background of photographs they sent back from these mysterious locations: here\u2019s an uncle waving at us from a glittering Times Square (Los Angeles); here\u2019s an aunt waving at us mid-way through the soft-focus neon breakfasts with Aunt Jemima\u2019s maple syrup (made from maple leaves); here\u2019s a nephew waving at us next to the poster of a red and white Michael Jordan in a quilted bedroom, his rotund brown body snuggled in tie-dye and tucked into tartan flannel sheets. Blackness was a rumor, that is, until Michael Jackson\u2019s Bad ripped into our consciousness and suddenly, knobby-kneed pre-teens found a way to make stringy curls with coconut oil stolen from their mothers\u2019 kitchens and started moonwalking backwards into my Social Studies classrooms, all snappy crotch and jaunty limbs. We girls rolled our eyes but we kept on watching.\nIt wasn\u2019t long before Jackson\u2019s unsparing gaze, draped in slick black leather, began replacing the glowing pastel Ganeshes and Saraswatis hanging above study desks. But replacing an elephantine god\u2019s soft paunch with lean, mean celebrity did not save us from our own ignorance of how blackness and brownness were connected through a struggle for economic self-realization and human rights. While kids in Chennai were rehearsing Michael Peters\u2019 signature choreography for \u201cThriller\u201d and pretending to be zombies\u2014little exemplary half-dead spectacles\u2014Union Carbide was industriously shirking responsibility for the Bhopal Tragedy, which choked thousands of Indians to death, and black mortality was spiking in violent, homicidal protest of the US DEA\u2019s drug buys and cocaine busts.\nIn other words, Tamilians blinked away Michael Jackson\u2019s blackness. We kept the heat and thunder of his fat synth bass, which found its way into Ilayaraaja\u2019s electric disco in films of the late 1980s like Vetri Vizha and Agni Natchathiram. We kept the ebullient automation of his moves, which became a muscular theme in Prabhu Deva\u2019s blend of baggy breakdance and whimsical terukoothu folk dancing in the 1990s. But we forgot his blackness. In time, the lightning of his presence was replaced by the grey hum of CNN, Cops, Law & Order, and the dull horror of handcuffs on dark wrists. Posters yellowed, cassettes spooled out, and my moonwalking classmates found their scientific calculators and study guides again.\nBut the rumors of racial difference in George Bush Sr.\u2019s America continued to bloom and wilt in morose cycles in my childhood homes into the 1990s. In damp clusters, it grew like moss under rocks. Rootless, it stretched its stringy arms and held us by the ankles; it grew like mold between bathroom tiles; it spun itself fine and strong, webbing into corners where our brooms couldn\u2019t reach. In time, the mossy rocks lined our after-dinner walks past the hibiscus bushes. In time, a grandmother slipped on the bathroom tiles and stayed in bed, fed conjee by a fatherless girl brought in from the village and the moss grew between her toes and drew her into the earth where they buried the nameless pets and tossed the chicken feathers. In time, the spiders hung so low they fell into pickle jars every time a child fished for a gooseberry or a slice of stony green mango from the brine. And from this brine, in time, we learned to believe that it existed. And as Tamilian families began drifting from the flashy monsoons of India to the June gloom of the California bay or to the sharp wet summers of the Keys, they carried the damp and stench in suitcases and buried it in hushed conversations. They made a poultice of moss and spider web and lodged it in the prayer books, hung it around the children\u2019s necks like a talisman, and they said\u2014as long as she doesn\u2019t marry a black man."}, {"3": {"here point sycamores": [3, 10, 15]}, "4": {"guide streets name": [2, 8, 12]}, "9": {"schiller park the only things on the window": [32, 33, 45, 60, 61, 81, 82, 83]}, "11": {"guide streets the mottled paintbynumber": [2, 8, 14, 17, 18]}, "13": {"your point is know": [1, 10, 57, 63]}, "14": {"schiller park the only things on the window branches": [32, 33, 45, 60, 61, 81, 82, 83, 94]}, "15": {"guide streets name": [2, 8, 12]}, "poem": "I\u2019m your guide here.

seat,\nStares out across the room\nAnd like a prophet cries:You\u2019re all going to die!\n \nThe class is a tomb.\nSerious, rigid, waits.\nA girl in pigtails giggles,\nThen another near the back.\nAnd as if along a fuse\nThe giggling goes\nUp and down the rows\nTill someone makes a crack\nAbout his coat and tie\nAnd the laughter detonates.\n \nSerious climbs slowly down\nInto that inferno of sound\nWhich the teacher\u2019s shouts\nAre only driving higher,\nPacks up his lunchbox, his dignity,\nAnd his copy of Sartre,\n \nAnd strides with a prophet\u2019s gaze\nThrough all that derisive fire.\nOnly once does he turn,\nBriefly, to look back through the blaze\nAt the iron fact of his art,\nSmaller from here, but unburned.\n \n \n5.\nSerious loves his Mum.\nAnd then he doesn\u2019t, quite.\nIt\u2019s that way with everything\u2014\nBaths and plums,\nThe bless\u00e8d silence of night.\n Would you like to help with this?\nHis mother asks\nAs she rolls out biscuit dough\nAnd cuts it with a glass\nOr folds the clothes\nStill warm from the sun.\nBut Serious knows\nHe was born with a task,\nAnd though he touches the clothes\nAnd tastes the dough,\nSerious says, No.\n \nSerious stays in the bath\nUntil his skin is shriveled and cold,\nEats himself sick on plums,\nFeels in the dark\nThe dark he becomes,\nAnd cries out in the night for his Mum.\n \n \n6.\nSerious is older now.\nHe just is.Thank God, Serious says,\nFor whom childhood, that stupid carousel that never stops,\nAlways had an element of disingenuousness:\nThe tristesse of lollipops,\nThe sham of naps;\nFools dandling you on their laps\nSo you can play horsey, which damn sure isn\u2019t serious;\nAnd all that endless business\nOf pretending to be curious\nAbout the most obvious things:\nWhat\u2019s night? Where\u2019s Mama-Cat?\nWhat\u2019s wrong with Pop? Can God die?\nWhy, why, why?\n \nTo hell with that,\nSerious thinks, as he sits incinerating memories\nOne by one,\nSaying their names as he feeds them\nLike photographs to a fire:\nHere he is in a baseball uniform\nSquinting back the sun;\nHere in a blue tuxedo with a ruffled front;\nAnd here, Lord, with pimples.\nHe pauses a moment.\nDo memories have names?\nAnd what, exactly, are these flames?\nTo hell with that!\nDone.\n \nSerious owns a car, pays taxes,\nContemplates a pension,\nHas a crease of gray along his temples,\nBut he is young, young.\nHe develops headaches, begins sleeping badly, and relaxes,\nYou might say, into the constant tension\nThat he really always was,\nWith far, far too much to do\nTo look anywhere but onward,\nOr to answer the questions of a child\nWith anything true.\n \n \n7.\nSerious isn\u2019t Stupid,\nThough they go to the same gym.\nSerious sees him dropping weights\nOr picking his butt and thinks,\nAt least I\u2019m not him.\nNor is he Mean or Vain,\nThose chiseled twins\nWith matching boots and belts,\nNor Smug who notes their sins,\nNor Shallow noting something else;\nHe isn\u2019t useless Timid\nWho no matter what won\u2019t complain,\nNor fat-assed Nice sweating honey\nOn all the machines,\nNor Self-Loathing who smudges mirrors,\nNor Whacked who licks them clean.\nSerious isn\u2019t Funny.\n \nSerious spreads his towel on the bench,\nSits down in front of his own image,\nAnd Serious strains at a serious weight.\nAnd never, not once, when he\u2019s seen\nIn myriad mirrors around the room\nThat everyone else is straining too,\nHas he caught himself too late\nAnd finished with a roar\nAnd more strength\nThan he\u2019s ever had before:I AM NOT YOU!\n \n \n8.\nSerious has a date with Doom.\nIt\u2019s not the first, and seems unlikely to be the last,\nFor they get on quite well, Doom and he,\nShare similar pasts\nAnd similar ideas about what life should be.\nIt seems, in fact, that this might just bloom.\n \nAnd what a relief.\nAfter Morose and Mad and Neurotic;\nAfter almost falling for Grief,\nWho was so exotic\nShe made all the others seem tame.\nThen to discover she even lied about her name.\nAnd to sleep with another Serious! That was odd,\nLike wrestling with an angel,\nThough it was hard to tell from that rough unsated tangle\nWhich one was Serious, and which one God.\n \nBut how easy it is to be himself with Doom,\nSerious thinks, as he puts the wine in to chill\nAnd sets two glasses on a tray,\nWho always wants whatever Serious wants\nAnd always agrees with what he has to say;\nWho doesn\u2019t need to hear that whole spiel\nAbout \u201cgoing too fast\u201d or \u201cneeding more room\u201d;\nAnd who doesn\u2019t probe and pry that long needle into his brain\n\u2014What do you feel? What do you feel?\u2014\nUntil it\u2019s all Serious can do not to stand up and scream: Pain!\n \nLucky to be alive.\nAnd if he still has no clear idea where she lives,\nAnd never knows quite when she\u2019ll arrive,\nStill, something about Doom feels right\nTo Serious, and he looks forward to their dates.\nHe checks himself in the mirror, dims the light,\nAnd waits.\n \n \n9.\nSerious is a traveler.\n\u201cTraveling broadens the mind,\u201d\nThe man beside him says,\nHis tray table down and seat reclined\nEven as they're taking off,\nAnd Serious, who has his eyes closed\nSo he can do what Serious does,\nBegins to cough.\n \n               What do they say, what do they fear, \n               Is this song joy or grief? \n               This is a man, this is a god. \n               Who are you and why are you here? \n               To leave, to leave.\n \nThe meal is over,\nWhich Serious declined.\nIn the shell-roar of the cabin\nHe eases somewhat, is surprised to find\nHe could almost drift away.\n\u201cWhat line of work are you in?\u201d\nHe hears the man beside him say,\nAnd Serious begins coughing wildly again.\n \n               What is that smell, what was that sound, \n               Isn\u2019t that ice on the wings? \n               This is the air, there is the water, \n               But what do you do on the way down? \n               You scream, you scream.\n \nHow far they must have gone by now,\nThat old familiar world miles behind,\nThe man eats an orange,\nAnd now he eats the rind.\nHe eats his plate, his plastic fork, chews\nWith animal relish his Styrofoam cup,\nLeans over to eat bittersweet Serious too,\nWho startles and wakes up.\n \n               Look at the desert, look at the green, \n               Is there an end to that ice? \n               Here is a place, and here is a place, \n               But what is the space between? \n               It\u2019s life, it\u2019s life.\n \n \n10.\nSerious is married.\nWhat a weird wind this is,\nHe thinks, so still at times,\nThen stinging the eyes to tears.\nAnd how he seems both more and less\nHimself, and how it seems at once all of loneliness\nAnd something he can hold.\nOr is it he who's being carried?\nHe shivers, and reaches out for her again.\nOr is it she who reaches, she who's cold?\nWhat is this wind?\nWhere are these years?\n \n \n11.\nSerious experiences loss.\nJust like that.\nFlat.\nSerious experiences loss,\n \nAs if he\u2019d come to some sheer cliff\nThere was no way around,\nNo way to cross,\nAnd found,\nOn the other side\nOf a deep canyon, himself,\nExperiencing loss.\n \nSerious, when the man is gone,\nTells himself that he tried,\nTells himself that he cried and cried\nFor all he was worth\nTo the man sitting on the other side\nExperiencing loss,\nWho one day simply vanished, or moved on,\nOr slipped off the edge of the earth\nAnd died.\n \n \n12.\nSerious doesn\u2019t speak French.\nThis embarrasses Serious,\nBecause insofar as he lives anywhere,\nSerious lives in Paris.\n \nHe feels the city stare,\nFeels himself sweat, and shake, as he tries to wrench\nThe little that he\u2019s gleaned\nInto the lot that he desires;\nFeels shopkeepers look at him as if he were a liar,\nWaiters as if he were unclean;\n \nAnd feels, in truth, not at all serious,\nAs if he had a huge balloon for a head\nAnd helium squeaks for a voice,\nAs if gravity could be merely a choice\nHe were making, and he might instead\nSimply stop, let go, and drift away.\n \nFinally Serious, opposed to epiphanies,\nHas one he can\u2019t resist.\nHe is Serious, and to be Serious\nIs to know something utterly or not at all,\nAnd to know, moreover,\nThat as you let your half-knowledge fall\nFrom you, it does not exist.\n \nJust like that Serious is himself again,\nSaying weighty things\nAbout the flowers in the stalls,\nPondering a splendid mirage\nCalled the Seine.\n \nAnd if he wakes saying fromage,\nOr in some shop feels\nRight on the verge of translating please,\nSerious knows it\u2019s a dream,\nAnd knows from childhood what to do.\nPoint and scream\nUntil the damn fools give you cheese.\n \n \n13.\nSerious has some culture.\nHe knows some things.\nAnd if, as he begins to speak,\nHe should feel the immense wings\nOf ignorance shadowing him, that dirty vulture\nThat squawks in drawl and drips tobacco juice,\nSerious knows what shelter to seek.\n \nPick a name and Bach is better.\nModernism was powerful but diffuse.\nLife\u2019s drained out of pictures since the Renaissance.\nTechnique! Technique! Technique!\nAnd about all that spastic flatulence\nCalled contemporary art,\nWell, Serious hardly knows where to start.\n \nSerious sits through opera without a yawn,\nChews up books on which weaker teeth would shatter;\nHe can tell you where one brushstroke lies,\nList the reasons courtly love is gone,\nPluck the speck of subject matter\nFrom Henry James.\nSerious knows some things.\n \nHe thinks and thinks and thinks\nUntil his ignorance shrinks\nTo the tiniest of flies\nAlighting somewhere in the Louvre.\nCarefully, carefully, Serious creeps\nWith his massive swatter,\nSaying, Don\u2019t move. Don\u2019t move.\n \n \n14.\nSerious believes in nothing.\nIt\u2019s a nice day, what should we do?\nWhat are you thinking?\nWhat\u2019s been bothering you?\nWhat\u2019s that you\u2019re drinking?\n \nSerious spreads the paper on his lap\nTo confirm what\u2019s new under the sun,\nHears a tap, tap, tap \nAgainst the windowpane.\n Nothing ventured, nothing gained,\nFloats up from childhood like a bit of ash,\nAnd Serious, pausing, can almost see\nHis old preacher, that atom bomb of idiocy\nWho every Sunday would explode.\nStill, Serious thinks, there\u2019s a truth to set you free.\nBut who could survive the blast?\n Tap, tap, tap.\n \nSerious skims the sports pages,\nReads about a storm that rages\nFar out at sea.\nSome talking dog is taking office,\nSome country wiping out monuments, expunging its past.\n Tap, tap, tap.\n Goddammit, Serious says, midway through a war,\nAnd thinks again of that old bore\nWho talked and talked and talked\nUntil you felt your head loll and sway\nLike some huge flower on a tiny stalk\nThat one good breeze would break;\n \nAnd how you\u2019d see him afterwards eating chicken fried steak,\nChicken fried man,\nWith a tiny transistor radio in his hand\nSo he could listen to the football game;\nAnd how his face seethed and writhed with what seemed pain\nIf he saw you coming to his booth,\nAnd he stared off as if some great truth\nWere finally, finally coming clear in that chicken fried brain\nAnd like a prophet he was going to stand up and shout\u2014\nUntil what plopped innocuously out\nWas your own name.\n Tap, tap, tap.\n \nSerious puts aside the news of the day\nAnd walks to the only window there is.\nBut there\u2019s no wind, not even the grass stirs.\nAnd anyway, there\u2019s no tree.\nSerious shrugs and turns away.\nMust just be me.\n \n \n13.\nSerious sees a child\nIn the playground across the street,\nSees his huge stupid head and huge stupid feet\nAs he tries to keep up with the games,\nAnd hears his sonar screams\nOf delight amid the other children's screams,\nAnd hears his timid weeping when they call him names.\n \nSerious sees the child standing apart sometimes\nDriveling to himself in silly rhymes,\nAnd sees him pretend to look intently at the sky\nIf Serious walks by,\nOr sees him simply stop and stare.\n \nGradually Serious starts seeing the child everywhere,\nIn a store standing in an aisle,\nIn the subway while\nSerious is trying to work on the way home,\nOr laughing with his family in a restaurant\nWhere Serious eats alone.\n \nSerious knows the truth.\nThis child wants something, his whole nature is want.\nAnd it begins to be annoying,\nThis novice cringing, all the imbecilic and cloying\nTactics of being cute,\nThe whole hangdog way he has of panhandling pity\nWith his freckles and his missing tooth,\nSitting all fidgety in his Sunday suit\nOr babbling happily as he\u2019s leaking snot;\n \nAnd then the air he suddenly puts on of being serious\nWhen it\u2019s so obvious he\u2019s not.\n \nSerious sees the child in the playground\nStanding to the side,\nSees his face whiten and his eyes go wide\nAs Serious crosses the street and strides\nUntil his shadow swallows the child\nAnd leans down close enough for them to kiss.I don\u2019t have time for this,\nSerious says,I\u2019ve got too much to do.\n \nAnd the child says, Who are you?\n \n \n16.\nSerious kills himself.No, no,\nShivering out of a dream,\nStarlight and the hard glitter\nUnder the bridge\u2019s beam,\nSerious, Serious,\nDon\u2019t go.\n \nSerious crawls out of bed,\nFeels the cold in the floor\nAnd thinks, suddenly, of lovely Mad\n(Where can she be?)\nWho\u2019d bolt out of sleep and screamFarmers get up at four!\nIt\u2019s three.\n \nSerious makes himself a cup of coffee,\nWhich he doesn\u2019t drink;\nTries and fails to read,\nTries and fails to think.\nSerious sits, and holds himself still,\nMinute by minute;\nUntil the dawn finally comes\nAnd he is in it.\n \n \n17.\nSerious lives alone.\nIt\u2019s better this way, he tells himself,\nAs he takes a pan from the pan shelf,\nA spatula from the spatula drawer,\nAnd fries two eggs the way he likes them:\nYolks of stone.\n \nNo more gnats of chatter over breakfast.\nNo more breakfast. It\u2019s noon.\nNo one prancing by with only panties on\nWhen he\u2019s almost, almost broken through,\nOr singsonging outside his doorSerious, O Serious, where are you?\nNo more!\n \nBut what, finally, does Serious do?\nHe sits, ignores the ringing phone,\nLooks at a wall\nOn one of the last warm days of the year,\nAnd settles back into the lifelong call\nOf being serious,\nWhich is to see, within that whiteness,\nLeaves being gently blown,\nAnd to feel their colors as they fall.\n \n \n18.\nSerious gives a speech.\nHe sets his papers on the podium,\nHis glass within easy reach,Tap, tap, taps the microphone.\nHow vast this venue is.\nHow absolute this darkness.\n To be serious is to be alone!\nSerious cries out with a triumphant look on his face,\nWaiting for the echoes to end\nOut there in all that space,\nWhich the words at once define and extend.\nIt takes a while, but they do die.\nThe spotlight lasers in.\nHe blinks hard, starts again.\n To know in every hand another\u2019s touch, To hear a silence words only intensify, To feel not too little but too much This attenuated world\u2014\n \nSerious begins to sweat,\nFeels the back of his shirt grow wet;\nLooks down to see his papers swirled\nAnd scattered, the glass on the floor, broken.\nWhat\u2019s with this fucking light, he thinks,\nOr was it spoken?\nHe glares out at the dark, impassive crowd\nAnd as if by force he could make them wake\nHears his voice growing loud:\n Whatever you most treasure you will break, Whatever you hold closest you will let go, There is no place that you will not leave! But to be serious\u2014\n                                  Serious says,\nQuietly now, because he has them, they are his\u2014\n To be serious, to be truly serious, is to know That what you call your losses you cannot grieve, For it was never quite these things that you wanted\u2014This treasure, this touch, this one place\u2014But by such life to be haunted.\n \nBrilliant!\nNo notes, no flaws.\nSerious stands back and waits for applause.\nThe hall is silent, utterly silent,\nThe heat tropic.\n \nSerious looks around, confused,\nTurns to the man who introduced him\nThen can\u2019t remember being introduced;\nAnd even given his credentials,\nThis suddenly seems a most unlikely topic.\n \nSerious tries to get out of the light,\nBut the light goes where Serious goes.\nHe blunders to the edge of the stage,\nA cliff\nBreaking off into a dark\nin which there's no movement, no voices, not one sigh.\n \nSerious feels the rage\nDraining out of him, and feels a chill, and whispers,Where am I?\n \n \n19.\nSerious nears an end.\nIt\u2019s cold and getting colder,\nAnd Serious, older,\nSits outside thinking of his good friend,\nWho like so much of Serious is gone,\nAnd thinking of that godforsaken dawn\nAfter the one night of his life he spent outdoors.\n Tell me,\nHis good friend said\nWhen Serious staggered out to the fire,Which form would you say is higher,Tragedy or comedy?\n \nAnd Serious, who had stumbled full-bladdered\nIn the night from a dream of bears,\nThen dreamed himself the object\nOf a dozen hungry stares,\nWho had swiveled, pissed into the tent,\nAnd sworn such things it would take a life to repent,\nSerious, exhausted Serious,\nWas silent.\n Because it\u2019s been troubling me,Serious, that the answer can only be tragedy.To be conscious is to be conscious ofLosing whatever it is that you most love,And thus an art that's truly greatWill always have one deepest truth to tell,Which is, my friend, this life is hell.\n \nSerious looks at the sky. It\u2019s late.\nA small wind blows\nThe trees, and Serious, shivering, knows\nHe should head inside,\nThat he is not well.\nBut sitting here, letting his eyes close,\nSerious can almost see that lake\nAflame with the early sun, and smell\nThe sweet burn of that wood,\nAnd feel the way it seemed his heart would surely break\nWere it not for the strange lightness in his head\nAs his friend smiled and said,But maybe earth is the heaven of the good.\n \n \n20.\nSerious talks to God.\nThere\u2019s no one else left.\nHis mind is mash,\nHis world is ash,\nAnd Serious occasionally forgets himself,\nThough he is not, not Bereft,\nThat sniveling idiot two doors down\nWho sits up late\nWith only ashes in the grate\nAnd talks to God.\n See? Serious says. See?Nothing.\nSerious spreads his arms magnanimously\nAs if to give God the floor.\nGod declines.Thou know\u2019st the first time that we smell the airWe wawl and cry,\nSerious says, louder than before.And then we wawl and cry some more,And then we die,And then we rot!\nAgain he waits in case\nThere\u2019s disagreement. There\u2019s not.\n \nSerious scoffs, goes to brush his teeth,\nForgets briefly to avert his eye\nFrom the mirror\u2019s glare\nAnd finds his father there,\n \nThat gentle baffled man\nWho, when there was no hope,\nWhen he couldn\u2019t even stand,\nCarved from a piece of soap\nA silly yellow duck\nAnd set it in a little yellow dish.\nSerious feels a tingling in his hair\nAnd mutters something close to a prayer,I wish, I wish...\n \nThe lights go out.Goddammit, Serious shouts\nAs he trips and falls\nTo his knees on the floor,\nBanging his head on the door\nAs he tries to rise.GodDAMMIT! Serious cries.\n \nThe lights come on.\nHis father\u2019s gone,\nBut there, at the edge of the sink,\nBalances the little duck in the little dish\nNo serious person would ever keep.\nSerious tries to think,\nSteadies himself as if at some brink,\nDecides he needs sleep,\nThat\u2019s what he needs,\nCrawling fully clothed into his bed\nAnd pulling the covers to his chin\nBecause, it seems, there\u2019s some strange wind\n \nThat\u2019s somehow gotten inside.\nSo unlike Serious,\nTo leave a door unclosed.\n \nYet here it is, gathering strength\nAs it blows his books\nOn the floor and it blows\nRight through his body and it blows\nBehind and below and above\nAnd out of the whirlwind a voice cries\n \n                    Love\n What? Serious says, as he tries\nTo sit upright and looks\nWildly around him,\nRaising his fist in the air.The things...I have lost\u2014\n \nImmediately he is tossed\nBack against the wall\nBy the force of a storm\nThat has no source, no form,\nAnd hears again the call\nOut of nowhere:\n \n                    Love\n My God! Serious screams,\nUnable to help himself,What maundering politician,What decerebrated pop star, What stupid puling poet Couldn\u2019t tell me that? \nStruggling to get out of bed\nHe starts to cough, then choke,\nA riot in his heart,\nA riot in his head\nAs he falls off the edge to the floor.Who do you think you are, \nHe gasps. Is this...
